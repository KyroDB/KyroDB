# AI-Native Database Vision Document

## Overview

This README serves as the vision document for ProjectKyro, an AI-native database designed to integrate artificial intelligence at its core. KyroDB aims to revolutionize data management by fusing self-optimizing learned components (AI4DB) with native support for AI workloads (DB4AI). This creates a database that is autonomous, efficient, and tailored for modern AI-driven applications, reducing operational overhead while accelerating AI development.

The document outlines researched components, features, and development stages in markdown lists, progressing from basic foundations to advanced capabilities. It includes a defined MVP, architectural insights, and benefits, drawing from academic research, industry trends, and practical implementations in systems like learned indexes and vector databases.

## Vision Statement
KyroDB envisions a future where databases are not just storage systems but intelligent entities that learn from data and workloads in real time. By embedding AI deeply into the database kernel, KyroDB will deliver self-driving operations, seamless AI integration, and superior performance for hybrid workloads—bridging traditional relational databases, vector stores, and autonomous systems. Target users include AI developers, data engineers, and enterprises handling semantic search, recommendations, and real-time analytics.

## Key Features: From Basic to Advanced

Features are categorized by maturity level, based on research from sources like Tsinghua/Waterloo papers on AI-native databases and MIT's work on learned indexes. Each level builds incrementally, ensuring a logical progression.

### Basic Features (Foundational Building Blocks)
- **Core Storage Engine**: A simple key-value store with durable persistence (WAL + snapshots).
- **SQL-Like Query Interface**: Fundamental CRUD and simple vector queries.
- **Data Ingestion Pipelines**: Batch and streaming inputs (append/subscribe).
- **Basic Monitoring**: Prometheus metrics for latency and throughput.

### Intermediate Features (Core AI Integration)
- **Learned Indexes**: Replace traditional B-trees with machine learning models (e.g., recursive model indexes) to predict data locations, improving lookup speed by up to 3x on read-heavy workloads while reducing memory footprint.
- **Vector Data Types**: Native support for high-dimensional embeddings, including storage and basic exact nearest neighbor search for semantic queries.
- **ML-Based Query Optimization**: Use supervised learning for cardinality estimation and cost modeling, outperforming heuristic-based optimizers on skewed datasets.
- **Autonomous Knob Tuning**: Reinforcement learning agents to automatically adjust configuration parameters like buffer sizes and parallelism based on workload patterns.

### Advanced Features (Full Autonomy and AI-First Design)
- **Multi-Dimensional Learned Indexes**: Extend learned structures to handle composite keys, spatial data, and temporal distributions with error-bounded guarantees for dynamic updates.
- **Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) Search**: Integrate algorithms like HNSW or IVF with hybrid filters for scalable semantic search, supporting retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) at production scales.
- **Declarative AI Operators**: SQL extensions for in-database model training, inference, and composition (e.g., `SELECT EMBED(text) FROM docs`), enabling joint optimization of data and AI pipelines.
- **Self-Healing and Predictive Maintenance**: Anomaly detection models that forecast failures, trigger automated recoveries, and adapt to hardware heterogeneity (e.g., GPU acceleration).
- **Provenance and Governance**: Built-in tracking of data lineage, model versions, bias detection, and compliance tools for trustworthy AI operations.
- **Federated Learning Support**: Enable distributed training across nodes while maintaining data privacy, for edge-to-cloud deployments.

## Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

- **Scope**:
  - Durable storage engine with learned index for KV (single-column key).
  - Vector support (exact + ANN) with SQL/HTTP.
  - One simple autotuned knob.
  - SQL limited to INSERT/SELECT and vector similarity.

- **Success Criteria**:
  - ≥2x faster point lookups with learned index vs baseline on synthetic workloads.
  - Vector demo app (semantic search) working end-to-end.
  - Crash safety (WAL recovery) and basic telemetry.

- **Technical Stack**:
  - Language: Rust for performance, Go for orchestration layer.
  - ML Framework: PyTorch for embedded models.
  - Testing: Use datasets from ANN-Benchmarks for vector search evaluation.

- **Risks and Mitigations**:
  - Challenge: Update handling in learned indexes—mitigate by starting with read-optimized designs and adding incremental updates later.
  - Validation: Beta testing with 10-20 users from AI developer communities.
