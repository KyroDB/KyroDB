The presence of communication amid scientific minds was equally important to the success of the Manhattan Project as scientific intellect was. The only cloud hanging over the impressive achievement of the atomic researchers and engineers is what their success truly meant; hundreds of thousands of innocent lives obliterated.
The Manhattan Project and its atomic bomb helped bring an end to World War II. Its legacy of peaceful uses of atomic energy continues to have an impact on history and science.
Essay on The Manhattan Project - The Manhattan Project The Manhattan Project was to see if making an atomic bomb possible. The success of this project would forever change the world forever making it known that something this powerful can be manmade.
The Manhattan Project was the name for a project conducted during World War II, to develop the first atomic bomb. It refers specifically to the period of the project from 194 … 2-1946 under the control of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, under the administration of General Leslie R. Groves.

The Manhattan Project. This once classified photograph features the first atomic bomb — a weapon that atomic scientists had nicknamed Gadget.. The nuclear age began on July 16, 1945, when it was detonated in the New Mexico desert.
Nor will it attempt to substitute for the extraordinarily rich literature on the atomic bombs and the end of World War II. This collection does not attempt to document the origins and development of the Manhattan Project.
Manhattan Project. The Manhattan Project was a research and development undertaking during World War II that produced the first nuclear weapons. It was led by the United States with the support of the United Kingdom and Canada. From 1942 to 1946, the project was under the direction of Major General Leslie Groves of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Nuclear physicist Robert Oppenheimer was the director of the Los Alamos Laboratory that designed the actual bombs. The Army component of the project was designated the
In June 1942, the United States Army Corps of Engineersbegan the Manhattan Project- The secret name for the 2 atomic bombs.
One of the main reasons Hanford was selected as a site for the Manhattan Project's B Reactor was its proximity to the Columbia River, the largest river flowing into the Pacific Ocean from the North American coast.
group discussions, community boards or panels with a third party, or victim and offender dialogues, and requires a skilled facilitator who also has sufficient understanding of sexual assault, domestic violence, and dating violence, as well as trauma and safety issues.

Tutorial: Introduction to Restorative Justice. Restorative justice is a theory of justice that emphasizes repairing the harm caused by criminal behaviour. It is best accomplished through cooperative processes that include all stakeholders. This can lead to transformation of people, relationships and communities. Practices and programs reflecting restorative purposes will respond to crime by: 1  identifying and taking steps to repair harm, 2  involving all stakeholders, and. 3  transforming the traditional relationship between communities and their governments in responding to crime.
Organize volunteer community panels, boards, or committees that meet with the offender to discuss the incident and offender obligation to repair the harm to victims and community members. Facilitate the process of apologies to victims and communities. Invite local victim advocates to provide ongoing victim-awareness training for probation staff.
The purpose of this paper is to point out a number of unresolved issues in the criminal justice system, present the underlying principles of restorative justice, and then to review the growing amount of empirical data on victim-offender mediation.
Each of these types of communities—the geographic community of the victim, offender, or crime; the community of care; and civil society—may be injured by crime in different ways and degrees, but all will be affected in common ways as well: The sense of safety and confidence of their members is threatened, order within the community is threatened, and (depending on the kind of crime) common values of the community are challenged and perhaps eroded.
The approach is based on a theory of justice that considers crime and wrongdoing to be an offense against an individual or community, rather than the State. Restorative justice that fosters dialogue between victim and offender has shown the highest rates of victim satisfaction and offender accountability.
Inherent in many people’s understanding of the notion of ADR is the existence of a dispute between identifiable parties. Criminal justice, however, is not usually conceptualised as a dispute between victim and offender, but is instead seen as a matter concerning the relationship between the offender and the state. This raises a complex question as to whether a criminal offence can properly be described as a ‘dispute’.
Criminal justice, however, is not usually conceptualised as a dispute between victim and offender, but is instead seen as a matter concerning the relationship between the offender and the state. 3 This raises a complex question as to whether a criminal offence can properly be described as a ‘dispute’.
The circle includes a wide range of participants including not only the offender and the victim but also friends and families, community members, and justice system representatives. The primary distinction between conferencing and circles is that circles do not focus exclusively on the offense and do not limit their solutions to repairing the harm between the victim and the offender.
Western betrayal. The concept of Western betrayal refers to the view that the United Kingdom and France failed to meet their legal, diplomatic, military and moral obligations with respect to the Czech and Polish nations during the prelude to and aftermath of the Second World War.
The Tuvan People's Republic, was proclaimed independent in 1921 and was a satellite state of Soviet Union until its annexation in 1944 by the Soviet Union. Another early Soviet satellite state in Asia was the short-lived Far East Republic in Siberia. Post-World War II
Satellite state. The term satellite state designates a country that is formally independent in the world, but under heavy political, economic and military influence or control from another country. The term was coined by analogy to planetary objects orbiting a larger object, such as smaller moons revolving around larger planets, and is used mainly to refer to Central and Eastern European countries of the Warsaw Pact during the Cold War or to Mongolia or Tannu Tuva between 1924 and 1990, for example. As used for

An interview with Anne Applebaum about her new book, The Crushing of Eastern Europe. Soviet-built tanks wheel into action in a smoke-filled Budapest street during Hungary's rebellion against communist satellite government in October of 1956.
They therefore,if anything, tightened their grip, Hungary 1956,Czechoslovakia 1968 and the construction of the Berlin Wall all being examples.After Stalin,it wasn't so much the desire to extend Soviet power as paranoia about losing it that maintained Soviet desire to control Eastern Europe.
There are 3 main reasons why Stalin wanted to control Eastern Europe. 1.) Russia has historically no secure border. 2.) They wanted to set up satellite countries. 3.)
Why did the United Nations send troops to Korea in 1950? They wanted to contain and push back the communist invaders from the North. Why was the Arab-Israeli conflict considered part of the Cold War?
On top of that, Russia had been the victim of attacks from the west multiple times. In 1914 and 1941 Germany attacked Russia through Poland. To Stalin, the past was a reliable indicator of what the future could hold. Stalin thought that having control over eastern europe could significantly undermine this threat. Despite this, it was agreed at the Yalta conference, with the consent of Stalin, that all the countries liberated from Nazi Germany would have the right to be democratic and politically independent.
Not just Eastern Europe, Stalin wanted to control the world by creating an empire based on Communism. That's how they clashed with US who intended to control the world by building an empire based on Capitalism. That's what the Cold War is about.
what to Do If I Stepped on Rusty Nail: Prevent Getting Tetanus. What to do if you step on a nail and are afraid to get Tetanus? Tetanus vaccines are available to help the body fight off the bacteria that causes this infection. Patients as young as two months are able to receive a tetanus shot.

Rusty Nail and Tetanus It is commonly advised that people should avoid rusty nails because they are dangerous. One of the most common beliefs is that piercing the skin with a rusty nail can cause you to develop tetanus or lockjaw. Tetanus is referred to as lockjaw because the initial symptoms of the disease will cause the muscles around the mouth to become rigid.
If you take an iron nail and let it rust in air, you'll find that the weight of the rusted nail is larger than that of the nail before it rusted. This gives the impression that the amount of mass hasn't remained constant, but what has really happened is that the oxygen in the air (which you didn't weigh) combined with the iron to make it rust. As a result, the weight of the oxygen plus the weight of the iron is equal to the weight of the rust that's formed. OK.
A: Nails rust in water because water allows the iron to react with any oxygen present, which forms iron oxide, known as rust. In order to cause rust quickly, there must be some impurities in the water, particularly salts, since these speed up the transfer of electrons from iron to oxygen.
It is possible to contract tetanus if you are cut by a rusty nail. Tetanus is caused by the clostridium tetani bacteria which are commonly found in dust, soil and animal feces. Because these items are commonly found around areas like gardens or work sites where rusty nails are present, the general belief that rusty nails cause tetanus was born. It is important to note that it is not so much the rust on the nail that causes people to contract tetanus, but the fact that nails can cause deep wounds that make it easier for the tetanus infection to spread.

Why is Atlanta the world’s busiest airport? With more than 250,000 passengers and nearly 2,500 arrivals and departures each day, a layover at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport is not uncommon.
Atlanta has the busiest airport in the world? Not New York City or Hong Kong? Whaaa? Here’s why: Delta’s HQ. In case you didn’t know, Delta Inc. has their headquarters in Atlanta. It was founded decades ago in Macon, Georgia but once Delta became a company they moved their headquarters north to Atlanta.
Trailing Atlanta in the rankings of the world’s busiest airports was China’s Beijing Capital International Airport, which held on to its No. 2 ranking again in 2016. “Many pundits anticipated that ATL would be overtaken by Beijing (PEK) by 2015, which held the world's second spot last year,” ACI added in its statement.
Atlanta became the first airport in the world to break that threshold in 2015, when it processed 101.5 million passengers. The passenger count rose again by 2.6% in 2016, jumping to 104.2 million fliers, according to ACI’s preliminary numbers.

In an effort to better understand how children form memories, the researchers asked 140 kids between the ages of 4 and 13 to describe their earliest memories and then asked them to do the same thing two years later.
Conversely, a third of the children who were age 10 to 13 during the first interview described the same earliest memory during the second interview. More than half of the memories they recalled were the same at both interviews. The researchers are now studying why children remember certain events and not others.
However, when the offset of childhood amnesia is defined as the age at which the majority of memories are personal recollections rather than known events, then offset occurs at approximately 4.5 years old.
The development of memory in children becomes evident within the first 2 to 3 years of a child's life as they show considerable advances in declarative memory. This enhancement continues into adolescence with major developments in short term memory, working memory, long term memory and autobiographical memory.
Most adults remember little before their third or fourth birthdays, and the thinking has been that prior to this age children do not have the cognitive or language skills to process and store events as memories.
The way that researchers study the memory capabilities of infants in this age range is through measuring eye movements between test images presented. After doing this initial round of testing, the researchers would conduct follow-up tests both 5 minutes later and one day later.
As this happens, memories occurring in the preschool years tend to be lost. “As young children get older their first memories tend to get later and later, but around age 10 their memories crystallize,” Peterson tells WebMD.
Childhood amnesia, also called infantile amnesia, is the inability of adults to retrieve episodic memories before the age of 2–4 years, as well as the period before age 10 of which adults retain fewer memories than might otherwise be expected given the passage of time.
In children under the age of 4, the memory storage capacity limitation constrains complex comprehension processes. As the child grows older however, less processing is necessary which opens more storage space for memory.
Recent research on the development of memory has indicated that declarative, or explicit memory, may exist in infants who are even younger than two years old. For example, newborns who are less than 3 days old demonstrate a preference for their mother’s own voice.

On average, Americans brush for just under the two minutes recommended by dental professionals. African Americans brush 18 seconds longer than Americans as a whole, while younger adults ages 18 to 24 spend 16 seconds longer than average brushing. Nearly six of 10 Americans brush their teeth at bedtime and as soon as they wake up in the morning, while 38 percent brush after breakfast. About 17 percent brush after lunch, and 21 percent brush after dinner.
Nearly six of 10 Americans brush their teeth at bedtime and as soon as they wake up in the morning, while 38 percent brush after breakfast. According to the Delta Dental survey, 91 percent of Americans brush most frequently at home in their bathrooms over the sink.
Distance of the teeth need to be moved- The amount of space or distance that is required to move the teeth can also determine the average length of time to wear braces. If one has a minor orthodontic problem and the teeth have to travel only a narrow distance, then one may have shorter time duration for treatment.
The average length of time to wear braces can vary from one individual to another. Depending on the condition of the teeth and gums, the space available, the severity of the misaligned teeth, the distance which the teeth needs to cover and the cooperativeness of the individual to instructions. However, the average length of time to wear braces is usually from 1 to 2 years. For some individuals braces may have to be worn for longer period of time up to 3 years or so and for some other individuals the time duration to wear braces may be lesser. Factors which determines the duration of braces treatment-.
Most adults do not come close to brushing that long. These four steps are the best and easiest ways to help you remember how to care for your mouth, teeth and gums: Brush at least twice a day with fluoride toothpaste for at least two minutes, especially first thing in the morning and before bedtime.
Use the tip of the brush to reach behind each front tooth on the top and bottom. In addition, don't forget flossing - it's just as important as brushing. If you don't brush your teeth long enough, you may not be getting your teeth clean enough. If you leave behind bacteria on the teeth after brushing, it can lead to serious problems such as gingivitis or periodontitis.
Though it is important to pay attention to how long you're brushing, it's even more important to make sure all surfaces are clean. Remember to brush using short strokes, moving back and forth against the teeth and gums, around the surface of every tooth.
In fact, according to the Delta Dental survey, people who brush at least twice a day are 22 percent more likely to describe their oral health as good or better compared with those who brush less frequently. Unfortunately, 23 percent of Americans have gone two or more days without brushing their teeth in the past year.

Phloem is a conductive (or vascular) tissue found in plants. Phloem carries the products of photosynthesis (sucrose and glucose) from the leaves to other parts of the plant. … The corresponding system that circulates water and minerals from the roots is called the xylem.
Phloem and xylem are complex tissues that perform transportation of food and water in a plant. They are the vascular tissues of the plant and together form vascular bundles. They work together as a unit to bring about effective transportation of food, nutrients, minerals and water.

Phloem is a conductive (or vascular) tissue found in plants. Phloem carries the products of photosynthesis (sucrose and glucose) from the leaves to other parts of the plant.
Unlike xylem (which is composed primarily of dead cells), the phloem is composed of still-living cells that transport sap. The sap is a water-based solution, but rich in sugars made by the photosynthetic areas.
In xylem vessels water travels by bulk flow rather than cell diffusion. In phloem, concentration of organic substance inside a phloem cell (e.g., leaf) creates a diffusion gradient by which water flows into cells and phloem sap moves from source of organic substance to sugar sinks by turgor pressure.
The mechanism by which sugars are transported through the phloem, from sources to sinks, is called pressure flow. At the sources (usually the leaves), sugar molecules are moved into the sieve elements (phloem cells) through active transport.
Phloem carries the products of photosynthesis (sucrose and glucose) from the leaves to other parts of the plant. … The corresponding system that circulates water and minerals from the roots is called the xylem.
Xylem transports water and soluble mineral nutrients from roots to various parts of the plant. It is responsible for replacing water lost through transpiration and photosynthesis. Phloem translocates sugars made by photosynthetic areas of plants to storage organs like roots, tubers or bulbs.

A confirmation is sent to the email address listed on the itinerary when the check-in is purchased. Purchases of the Early Bird Check-In are not refundable, and passengers who cancel their reservation must forfeit the option for that particular flight. In the rare event that Southwest cancels a flight, a refund will be issued within one or two billing cycles.
Save this Post. 1. Re: Southwest Airline's Early Bird Check-In Policy. Jul 22, 2012, 1:07 AM. It is my understanding that Business Select, and A list rapid rewards people are automatically AHEAD of early bird people. So, if there are a lot of them on the flight--you are pushed back.
All customers are subject to physical search at the security checkpoint. Random physical searches of customers, either through use of wands or pat down methods at the security checkpoint, will be ongoing.
Early Bird Check-In passengers board after Business Select and A-List Customers. There are several ways to purchase the early check-in, including online, over the phone through a reservation agent or through the Southwest mobile app.
When I purchased my ticket and early bird check-in in late March for a mid-July domestic flight on Southwest, common sense made me think that my purchased boarding position ($10 for each of the two flights) would reflex the early purchase date and be related to an early bird process.
Am I correct in assuming that Southwest Airlines puts your name/confirmation number in a hat and pulls it out along with all the other people who also paid for the early bird check-in to determine your boarding pass location?
Upon inquiring at the check-in kiosk, Southwest personnel were not surprised and commented that sometimes early bird check-in can result in a C boarding position (an additional 60 positions farther back in boarding).
For a small fee, Southwest Airlines' Early Bird Check-In allows passengers to check-in to a flight automatically up to 36 hours prior to the flight's scheduled departure time.
While not guaranteed, most Early Bird Check-In passengers obtain an A boarding pass, which allows them to board the plane earlier than most passengers.
Check in online. Check in online and print your boarding pass beginning 24 hours in advance of departure. You will need your airline confirmation number (or PNR) and first and last name to retrieve your reservation. What to expect at the airport and while boarding the plane.

Yes, whiskers are used to help animals balance themselves like we need our pinky toe for balance.
In addition to having sensory properties, a cat's whiskers are also a good indicator of his mood. When a cat is angry or feels defensive, the whiskers will be pulled back. Otherwise, when the cat is happy, curious or content, the whiskers will be more relaxed and pushed forward. But the whisker's primary use is to help a cat judge whether or not he'll fit through an opening. A cat's whiskers are roughly as wide as his body -- sort of a natural ruler. The whisker tips are sensitive to pressure. You'll probably see a cat stick his head in and out of an opening before he puts his body in. He's judging the width of the opening, and is determining if he can fit into it.
Yes whiskers are used to help balance as well as feelers to help them judge space and help in the dark. A cats tail also helps them balance, my cat had lost his tail do to an … injury and now he uses his whiskers more to help balance.
The Cat Fanciers’ Association (which is to cats what the AKC is to dogs) has this listed on its page of myths about cats (http://www.cfainc.org/articles/myths-facts .html) Myth: A cat’s sense of balance is in its whiskers. Fact: Cats use their whiskers as “feelers” but not to maintain their balance. So you aren’t the only one to hear this old wives’ tale, but you can put the scissors away, even though it was in the name of scientific curiosity.
Like cats and other animals, dogs have whiskers that stick out from the sides of their muzzle. Technically, they aren’t whiskers – they’re called vibrissae, which comes from a Latin word “vibrio” that means to vibrate. A dog’s whiskers are actually highly tuned, multi-functional, sensitive sensory hairs they need and use every day to perform specific functions that help them move around in their world. Dog whiskers are found on both sides of their muzzle, as well as on the forehead above the eyes, on their chin and above the upper lip.
Whiskers are rooted very deep in the cat's face, in an area rich in nerves and blood vessels. In addition to having the long tactile hairs on their cheeks, cats also have shorter ones above their eyebrows, on their chin and on the back of their front legs.
As puppies grow, the whiskers are among the first hairs to develop. Unlike the neatly arranged 12 whiskers in four rows on each side of a cat’s face, dog whiskers are more varied in their pattern depending on their breed and genetics. Whiskers are twice as thick and coarser than regular dog hair.
Do cats use their whiskers for balance? Yes the whiskers help them balance as well as the tail. All the senses work together to help the cat get around in the dark or tight places. If the cat should lose one or the … other then the other senses get stronger to help w/whatever they lost.
Yes whiskers are used to help balance as well as feelers to help them judge space and help in the dark. A cats tail also helps them balance, my cat had lost his tail do to an …injury and now he uses his whiskers more to help balance. Even though Issacc lost his tail his balance is as good as ever, they adapt.

In this post, we’ll break down the “Doing Business As” (DBA) to see if your business needs one. What Is a DBA? In the U.S., a DBA lets the public know who the real owner of a business is. The DBA is also called a Fictitious Business Name or Assumed Business Name. It got its origins as a form of consumer protection, so dishonest business owners can’t try to avoid legal trouble by operating under a different name.
In some cases, you don’t need a DBA if your business name is a combination of your name and a description of your product or service. In this case, if my business was called Nellie Akalp’s Gardening Service, I may not need a DBA. But, if it’s just my first name (aka Nellie’s Gardening Service), then a DBA is required.
Some states require DBA or fictitious business name filings to be made for the protection of consumers conducting business with the entity. . A company is said to be doing business as when the name under which they operate their business differs from its legal, registered name. Some states require dba or fictitious business name filings to be made for the protection of consumers conducting business with the entity. If you're starting a sole proprietorship or a partnership, you have the option of choosing a business name or dba (doing business as) for your business.
However, in cases of DBA, an individual does not use their own name as the company’s legal name. For example, there is an individual named James Doe and he is the owner of a laundry service. He wants to call his laundry service “Get’m Clean Laundry”.

This fee is most commonly debited from your account each quarter; in this example it would be $250 per quarter.hese fees can range from $9.95 per trade to over $50 per trade. If you are investing small amounts of money, these fees add up quickly. Example: A $50 transaction fee on a $5,000 investment is 1%. A $50 transaction on $50,000 is only .10%, which is very minimal.

Do the math. If returns average, say, 8% a year, then those same fees are not 1% or one-half of 1%. They are much higher — typically over 12% for individuals and 6% for institutions. But even this recalculation substantially understates the real cost of active “beat the market” investment management.een for what they really are, fees for active management are high — much higher than even the critics have recognized. When stated as a percentage of assets, average fees do look low — a little over 1% of assets for individuals and a little less than one-half of 1% for institutional investors.
The numbers above reflect what the average investor pays in expense ratios, according to the Investment Company Institute (ICI).

Hope that helps your question
The COPD Foundation reported that the disease causes the most days of lost productivity than any other chronic condition. Medical Requirements in the Blue Book. When the SSA receives an application for disability benefits, they evaluate it against a number of requirements.
COPD can be found in Section 3.02—Chronic pulmonary insufficiency, under Respiratory Disorders. In order to qualify for benefits, you must meet one of the following requirements: COPD, due to any cause, with a forced expiratory volume one (FEV1) that is equal to or lower to the minimum for your height, between 1.05 for those who are five feet and 1.65 or those who are six feet.

If you meet the requirements of this listing, you automatically qualify for benefits.
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease and Social Security Disability COPD, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is a series of lung diseases that damages your lungs, blocking airflow and affecting your ability to breathe. The two most common conditions are chronic bronchitis and emphysema.
A question I'm often asked is whether a person can get SSDI or SSI benefits for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). COPD is also called chronic bronchitis or emphysema. The answer to the question is this - if your COPD is severe enough, you can qualify for SSDI or SSI. COPD is a listing level disease, which means the SSA has laid out the criteria for it to be automatically considered a disability. This is important because if your COPD meets the requirements in the listing, then the SSA does not have to evaluate whether or not your COPD restrict your functional capacity to such a degree that you qualify for disability benefits. To see if you meet the listing criteria for COPD, read our article on the chronic pulmonary insufficiency listing.

On the other hand, when the basic salary is increased from the optimal percentage, a smaller amount of CTC is allocated to HRA and the tax benefit on HRA is not fully utilised. Also, the employee pays tax on this amount which is now allocated under basic salary. This translates into a greater tax liability.ohan's tax liability vs basic salary.

The inter-quartile range is a measure that indicates the extent to which the central 50% of values within the dataset are dispersed. It is based upon, and related to, the median. In the same way that the median divides a dataset into two halves, it can be further divided into quarters by identifying the upper and lower quartiles.
Measures of average such as the median and mean represent the typical value for a dataset. Within the dataset the actual values usually differ from one another and from the average value itself. The extent to which the median and mean are good representatives of the values in the original dataset depends upon the variability or dispersion in the original data. Datasets are said to have high dispersion when they contain values considerably higher and lower than the mean value.

Folate and folic acid are forms of a water-soluble B vitamin. Folate occurs naturally in food, and folic acid is the synthetic form of this vitamin. Since 1998, folic acid has been added to cold cereals, flour, breads, pasta, bakery items, cookies, and crackers, as required by federal law.
Folic acid is a type of B vitamin. It is the man-made (synthetic) form of folate that is found in supplements and added to fortified foods. Folate is a generic term for both naturally occurring folate found in foods and folic acid.
Vitamin B9, also called folate or folic acid, is one of 8 B vitamins. All B vitamins help the body convert food (carbohydrates) into fuel (glucose), which is used to produce energy. These B vitamins, often referred to as B-complex vitamins, also help the body use fats and protein.
Folic acid is the synthetic form of B9, found in supplements and fortified foods, while folate occurs naturally in foods. All the B vitamins are water-soluble, meaning the body does not store them. Folic acid is crucial for proper brain function and plays an important role in mental and emotional health.
Folic acid is a pregnancy superhero! Taking a prenatal vitamin with the recommended 400 micrograms (mcg) of folic acid before and during pregnancy can help prevent birth defects of your baby's brain and spinal cord.
Folic acid is a pregnancy superhero! Taking a prenatal vitamin with the recommended 400 micrograms (mcg) of folic acid before and during pregnancy can help prevent birth defects of your baby's brain and spinal cord. Take it every day and go ahead and have a bowl of fortified cereal, too.
Folic acid is one of the B vitamins found in foods such as leafy green vegetables, fruits, dried beans, and peas. A synthetic form of folic acid is used in dietary supplements and fortified foods. Folic acid acts by helping the body produce and maintain new cells.
They also help the nervous system function properly. Folic acid is the synthetic form of B9, found in supplements and fortified foods, while folate occurs naturally in foods. All the B vitamins are water-soluble, meaning the body does not store them.
Folate is a generic term for both naturally occurring folate found in foods and folic acid. Folic acid is water-soluble. Water-soluble vitamins dissolve in water. Leftover amounts of the vitamin leave the body through the urine.
Women who are pregnant or might become pregnant take folic acid to prevent miscarriage and “neural tube defects,” birth defects such as spina bifida that occur when the fetus’s spine and back do not close during development. Some people use folic acid to prevent colon cancer or cervical cancer.
SQL clauses site was designed to help programmers and IT professionals, yet unfamiliar with SQL (Structured Query Language) to learn the language and use it in their everyday work. Our tutorial shows how to put into practice various SQL clauses, SQL commands, SQL statements and SQL operators. If SQL clauses and commands like SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, WHERE, JOIN, DISTINCT, ORDER BY, GROUP BY, HAVING, and UNION sound like ancient Greek to you, then you have come to the right place.
WHERE {column or expression} comparison-operator value. Syntax for a WHERE clause with Select statement is: SELECT column_list FROM table-name. WHERE condition; 1  column or expression - Is the column of a table or a expression.  comparison-operator - operators like = < > etc.
So SQL offers a feature called WHERE clause, which we can use to restrict the data that is retrieved. The condition you provide in the WHERE clause filters the rows retrieved from the table and gives you only those rows which you expected to see. WHERE clause can be used along with SELECT, DELETE, UPDATE statements.
When you want to retrieve data from a database, you ask for the data by using Structured Query Language, or SQL. SQL is a computer language that closely resembles English that database programs understand. Knowing SQL is important because every query in Microsoft Access uses SQL.
In the above SQL statement: 1  The SELECT clause specifies one or more columns to be retrieved; to specify multiple columns, use a comma and a space between column names. To retrieve all columns, use the wild card * (an asterisk).  The FROM clause specifies one or more tables to be queried.
SQL is a computer language for working with sets of facts and the relationships between them. Relational database programs, such as Access, use SQL to work with data. Like many computer languages, SQL is an international standard that is recognized by standards bodies such as ISO and ANSI.
The WHERE Clause is used when you want to retrieve specific information from a table excluding other irrelevant data. For example, when you want to see the information about students in class 10th only then you do need the information about the students in other class.
To describe a set of data by using SQL, you write a SELECT statement. A SELECT statement contains a complete description of a set of data that you want to obtain from a database. This includes the following: What tables contain the data. How data from different sources is related.
You can use a different name to refer to a data source in a SELECT statement by using a table alias in your FROM clause. A table alias is a name that you assign to a data source in a query when you use an expression as a data source, or to make the SQL statement easier to type and read.
We have illustrated the SQL clauses and SQL commands usage with simple examples, where appropriate. If you want to learn SQL faster, than it's advisable to re-create the examples given in our SQL tutorial in a real RDBMS environment and play with them.

Current Store: Current Store: Food City actually dates back to 1918 when a store was opened in Greeneville, Tennessee, but K-VA-T Food Stores’ official beginning took place in 1955 when founder Jack C. Smith--with his father, Curtis and uncle, Earl--opened the first store in Grundy, Virginia.
A grocery store is a retail store that primarily sells food. A grocer is a bulk seller of food. Grocery stores often offer non-perishable food that is packaged in cans, bottles and boxes, with some also having fresh produce, butchers, delis, and bakeries. Large grocery stores that stock significant amounts of non-food products, such as clothing and household items, are called supermarkets.
Your Certified Organic Grocery Store. Courtney Mudge is the Organic Certification Manager for Whole Foods Market. She's a 5th generation Texan who grew up on a ranch in the Hill Country. When she's not coaching our stores on organic integrity, she's being crafty and searching for the perfect taco.
Not so much. Well, like those apples and that beef, Whole Foods Market stores are certified organic. “Wait, what?” – you may ask – “A grocery store can be certified organic?” Yes, it can and we are. Though, I admit it’s a little confusing, especially since not ALL the products in our stores are organic.
The US Labor Department has calculated that food purchased at home and in restaurants is 13% of household purchases, behind 32% for housing and 18% for transportation. The average US family spent $280 per month or $3,305 per year at grocery stores in 2004.

Prize money and winnings from writing competitions are a taxable source of income.

As the prize is taxable then the competition entry fees will be an allowable expense against such income.”.
Therefore, if the taxpayer receives any such award/winnings, then such winnings will be liable to tax as part of his total income for a particular tax year.

Communication in the Nervous System: Neurons. There are two major types of cells in the nervous system: glia and neurons. Neurons are cells that receive, integrate, and transmit information. In the human nervous system, the vast majority are interneurons-neurons that communicate with other neurons.
The cerebral cortex in humans. The cerebral cortex consists of right and left halves, called cerebral hemispheres. This diagram provides a view of. the right hemisphere. Each cerebral hemisphere is divided into four lobes (which are highlighted in the bottom inset): the occipital lobe, the parietal. lobe, the temporal lobe, and the frontal lobe.
The limbic system is a loosely connected network of structures involved in emotion, motivation, memory, and other aspects of behavior.

Cerebral Hemispheres – two specialized halves connected by the . corpus collosum. Left hemisphere – verbal processing: language, speech, reading, writing. Right hemisphere – nonverbal processing: spatial, musical, visual recognition. The cerebrum is divided into two specialized hemispheres that are connected by the corpus collosum. The corpus collosum is a thick band of fibers (axons) that transmits information between the hemispheres.

The largest and most complex part of the human brain - includes the brain areas that are responsible for our most complex mental activities, including learning, remembering, thinking, and consciousness.
The two neurons are separated by the synaptic cleft, a microscopic gap between the terminal button of one neuron and the cell membrane of another neuron. Signals have to cross this gap for neurons to communicate. The neural impulse is a signal that must be transmitted from a neuron to other cells.
In the human brain, there are about ten glia cells for every neuron. Glia come in a variety of forms. Their main function is to support the neurons by, among other things, supplying them with nutrients and removing waste material. In the human brain, there are about ten glia cells for every neuron.

SGO Clinical Practice Statement: Salpingectomy for Ovarian Cancer Prevention. SGO Clinical Practice Statement: Salpingectomy for Ovarian Cancer Prevention. Salpingectomy may be appropriate and feasible as a strategy for ovarian cancer risk reduction.
Ovarian cancer has the highest mortality rate out of all types of gynecologic cancer and is the fifth leading cause of cancer deaths among women (1). The overall survival rate for women with epithelial ovarian cancer has improved marginally in the past 50 years.
In the Nurses’ Health Study, all-cause mortality and cancer mortality increased in women who received a BSO (16). The risk of ovarian cancer after hysterectomy with ovarian conservation is 0.1–0.75% (17). Death from ovarian cancer after tubo-ovarian conservation in the Nurses’ Health Study was 0.03% (16).

Salpingectomy for Ovarian Cancer Prevention. ABSTRACT: Ovarian cancer has the highest mortality rate out of all types of gynecologic cancer and is the fifth leading cause of cancer deaths among women.
Salpingectomy is the surgical removal of one or both fallopian tubes. The fallopian tubes serve as a passageway for an ovum to travel from the ovary to the uterus. In a unilateral salpingectomy, only one fallopian tube is removed; in a bilateral salpingectomy, both fallopian tubes are removed. A salpingectomy can be performed for a number of reasons, including treatment of ectopic pregnancies and infections in the fallopian tubes (salpingitis).
In our opinion, introduction of bilateral salpingectomies at the time of tubal ligation or hysterectomy for benign gynecologic patients is a reasonable option. In the absence of good screening tests, this procedure is the only form of prophylaxis for a cancer that is difficult to detect and often lethal when found. Physicians should at least present patients with this option during presterilization and prehysterectomy counseling.
Light Work usually requires walking or standing to a significant degree. However, if the use of the arm and/or leg controls requires exertion of forces greater than that for Sedentary Work and the worker sits most the time, the job is rated Light Work.
November 2013. Salpingectomy may be appropriate and feasible as a strategy for ovarian cancer risk reduction. A paradigm shift in our understanding of pelvic serous carcinomas suggests that the site of origin may be the fallopian tube.
Laparoscopic bilateral salpingectomy. Laparoscopic bilateral salpingectomy. Laparoscopic bilateral salpingectomy: Laparoscopic bilateral salpingectomy is a minimally invasive procedure to remove both fallopian tubes using a tiny video camera (laparoscope) and other instruments inserted through several small keyhole incisions in the lower abdomen.

Chromium, without picolinate, is a natural mineral found in many foods such as meat, unprocessed foods, fats and vegetable oil [source: Larsen ]. Specific foods that have chromium in them naturally include carrots, potatoes, broccoli, whole grains and molasses [source: Merck ].Other examples include eggs, beef and brewer's yeast [source: Any Vitamins ]. Chromium is paired with acidic picolinate in pill form to help aid the body's ability to absorb the mineral.Picolinate is produced when tryptophan is made, therefore it's also known as a by-product of tryptophan [source: Merck ].t worst, they can cause serious side effects and complications.

1 Prescriptive Easements. 2  Even where an access easement does not exist, or where an access easement prohibits dockage or the mooring of boats, back lot owners sometimes trespass over riparian property to obtain access to the waters, or to wrongfully install docks and moor boats.
An easement is the permanent right to use a portion of the property of another for a specific use or purpose. Easements are typically created (or reserved) by an express document, whether it be a deed, land contract, dedication in a plat, a deed restriction document, or a specific easement agreement.
Wisconsin state law prohibits a riparian owner from conveying any riparian right, except for the right to access the water by crossing over the upland. 1 This prohibition is quite unique. In the vast majority of states, riparian rights can be severed from the land and transferred freely.
Riparian Property Rights: A riparian proprietor is a person who is in possession of riparian lands or who owns an interest therein, and the proprietor is the only person that holds the riparian rights in riparian property.
Riparian Rights in Michigan Riparian rights are property rights which run with the land. Only land which abuts a natural body ofwater has riparian rights. A riparian property owner has the following property rights:1. Access to water.2. Install a dock anchored to his bottomland.3.

A triglyceride is an ester derived from glycerol and three to four fatty acids. Triglycerides are the main constituents of body fat in humans and other animals, as well as vegetable fat. They are also present in the blood to enable the bidirectional transference of adipose fat and blood glucose from the liver, and are a major component of human skin oils. There are many different types of triglyceride, with the main division between saturated and unsaturated types. Saturated fats are saturated
A triglyceride (TG, triacylglycerol, TAG, or triacylglyceride) is an ester derived from glycerol and three to four fatty acids (from tri-and glyceride). Triglycerides are the main constituents of body fat in humans and other animals, as well as vegetable fat. They are also present in the blood to enable the bidirectional transference of adipose fat and blood glucose from the liver, and are a major component of human skin oils.
For adults, triglyceride test results are categorized as follows: 1  Desirable: Less than 150 mg/dL (1.7 mmol/L) 2  Borderline high: 150 to 199 mg/dL (1.7-2.2 mmol/L) 3  High: 200 to 499 mg/dL (2.3-5.6 mmol/L) 4  Very high: Greater than 500 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L)
Triglycerides. 1  Blood tests for triglycerides are usually part of a lipid profile that is used to help identify an individual's risk of developing heart disease and to help make decisions about what treatment may be needed if there is borderline or high risk.
Testing may be ordered more frequently when people have identified risk factors for heart disease. 1  Some risk factors for heart disease include: 2  Cigarette smoking. 3  Being overweight or obese. 4  Unhealthy diet. 5  Being physically inactive—not getting enough exercise. 6  Age (men 45 years or older or women 55 years or older)
Ranges with anything over 499 are being considered extremely high. But these numbers serve more as just a measurement method. They are used to assess risk. Most people wondering what are triglycerides also want to know what having elevated triglycerides levels can mean for the body. Atherosclerosis is the biggest risk associated with having high triglycerides levels.
Sometimes, this storage comes in the form of excess fat in the midsection. Figuring out just what are triglycerides means understanding where they come from. In most cases, triglycerides are the result of digestion and the body breaking down fats. Sometimes they also are the byproduct of carbohydrates as well. While the fats are not always a bad thing, having triglycerides too high can be and for a multitude of reasons.
What Are Triglycerides Levels and Why Do They Matter? When most people ask what are triglycerides, it is because they associate the word with being bad for the body. In fact, they are incredibly important to many body processes and are considered the main form of fat within the body. The body uses triglycerides for energy, which is a good thing.
A triglyceride (TG, triacylglycerol, TAG, or triacylglyceride) is an ester derived from glycerol and three fatty acids (from tri- and glyceride). Triglycerides are the main constituents of body fat in humans and other animals, as well as vegetable fat. They are also present in the blood to enable the bidirectional transference of adipose fat and blood glucose from the liver, and are a major component of human skin oils.
Triglycerides are utilized in the body by offering a source of energy to cells that require it. They are a normal component of the blood and are naturally stored in fat deposits. However, when present in excess triglycerides can cause problems in the body and lead to serious diseases.
Saturday, May 19, 2012. Cunnilingus is a sexual act where a woman’s genital area is stimulated by her partner’s lips, mouth and tongue. “Cunnilingus” is derived from two Latin words; “cunnus” meaning vulva (hello lady parts!) and “lingua” which means tongue. The big word basically describes oral sex performed on a woman for the purpose of sexual pleasure. Most people who engage in oral sex find it extremely pleasurable.

Today, President Obama delivered the commencement address to the 2013 graduates of Morehouse College in Atlanta, GA. “It is one of the great honors of my life to be able to address this gathering here today,” President Obama told the graduates.
ATLANTA, November 12, 2012 – The Morehouse College Board of Trustees today announced that Dr. John Silvanus Wilson Jr. has been named the College’s 11th president. The appointment follows a rigorous, nationwide search conducted with professional recruitment firm Heidrick & Struggles.
Before working with the White House Initiative, Wilson was an associate professor of higher education in the Graduate School of Education at George Washington University (GWU). He also served as the executive dean of GWU’s Virginia campus, and he helped to develop a strategic plan for the university.
Wilson spent the first 16 years of his career at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), ultimately becoming the director of foundation relations and assistant provost, where he more than doubled the productivity of the office he managed and reached a record annual revenue stream of more than $50 million.
Wilson recently has served as a consultant to the United Negro College Fund Institute for Capacity Building's HBCU Institutional Advancement Program and on the Kresge Foundation's Black College Advisory Board. From 1996 through 2000, he served as chair of the Alumni Council of the Harvard Graduate School of Education.
“I thank the Board and the search consultants for their thorough evaluation of the excellent pool of candidates and commend all on their outstanding recommendation,” said Robert C. Davidson Jr., chairman of the Morehouse College Board of Trustees.
I am very pleased to announce that following a comprehensive and rigorous search process, the Morehouse Board of Trustees, by a unanimous vote, has selected Dr. John Silvanus Wilson, Jr. to be the 11th president of the College.
For 10 years, Wilson served as the president of the Greater Boston Morehouse College Alumni Association. In that role, he led an effort to raise more than half a million dollars toward scholarships and another half million dollars toward community outreach for his alumni chapter.
Dr. Wilson, a 1979 graduate of the College, comes to Morehouse with more than 25 years of leadership in higher education and a strong and successful record in institutional fundraising.

What causes tooth root resorption? A: A study on external root resorption in the journal Schweiz Monatsschr Zahnmed states that trauma, periodontitis, orthodontic treatment, internal bleaching, cysts, tumors or stimuli from a necrotic dental pulp may cause tooth root resorption.
Over time, all areas of an affected tooth, from root to crown, may become involved. Tooth resorption is a common condition, affecting an estimated 20 percent to 60 percent of all cats and close to three-quarters of those five years of age and older.
The unerupted tooth. An unerupted tooth can exert pressure against a neighboring root, to cause resorption similar to that from orthodontic treatment. Typical examples include the forward-leaning lower wisdom tooth which is impacted against the back of the standing second molar and causes damage where the two meet.
In a condition known as a tooth resorption –formerly referred to as feline odontoclastic resorptive lesion (FORL) or cervical line lesion—the dentin in a single tooth (or several simultaneously) erodes and eventually becomes irreparably destroyed.
What Is “Tooth Resorption”? Tooth resorption is loss of hard dental tissue, but not from decay. This means that the substance of a tooth is broken down by certain specialised body cells and then absorbed. Resorption thus causes some of a tooth, generally in the root area, to just disappear. In the developing child there is a natural physiological resorption of the roots to allow for the exfoliation, or shedding of the first set of teeth at the appropriate time.
(Redirected from Root resorption) Tooth resorption is a process by which all or part of a tooth structure is lost due to activation of the body's innate capacity to remove mineralized tissue, as mediated via cells such as osteoclasts. Types include external resorption and internal resorption. It can be due to trauma, infection, or hyperplasia.
Within each of a cat’s teeth is a chamber (root canal) that contains tissue made up of blood vessels, lymphatic vessels, and nerves. This tissue, which communicates with the rest of the animal’s body, is surrounded by a bony substance called dentin, which accounts for the bulk of the tooth’s structure.
The best way of confirming the suspected presence of the condition, she notes, is by means of a full-mouth intra-oral radiograph. If veterinary examination reveals the presence of tooth resorption, Dr. Rawlinson points out, the only effective treatment will entail extraction of any affected teeth.
El-Bialy states that orthodontically induced inflammatory root resorption differs from other types of tooth root resorption, and treatment protocol for this type always involves a root canal treatment or extraction of these teeth in severe cases and prosthetic replacement.
Everyday Health indicates that the majority of patients who go through orthodontic therapy do not get root resorption. Everyday Health also explains that many teeth with root resorption still function properly and may last for many years or even a lifetime despite resorption.

Benefits of Portable Oxygen Tanks. Usually a person’s first instinct is to get a larger model simply because it holds more oxygen, which saves you the trouble of having to get it refilled every so often. However the drawback is that it is as good as tying you down to one place.
While this may be convenient and useful for a person who is bed-ridden, it is not practical for someone who is capable of and wants to move around. 1  Better Portability-Portable oxygen tank cylinders are light, convenient to carry around, which means you can have oxygen to go whenever you need it.

What is perhaps not so well known is the fact that acetylene – because of its high flammability – can present a serious safety hazard. So cylinders containing acetylene, like all gas cylinders, should be transported, stored and handled properly to ensure they are completely safe. Unfortunately, safety is not always accorded the importance it deserves.
All patients gave written informed consent. The chemotherapy/conditioning regimens 'BEAM' and Fludarabine – 2 Gy TBI are considered standard chemotherapy/conditioning regimens in our internal handbook of the stem-cell transplant unit. The handbook is revised on a regular basis and approved by the Ethics Committee.
The baseline EDSS score in 58.5 % of the subjects was 6.5 and 78 % had a score of 6.0 or higher, respectively. The complication rate during the intra-transplantation period was 56 % for all patients: 71.4 % of the patients in the BEAM / hATG group and 40 % in the CY / rATG group (P = 0.04).
BEAM is a type of chemotherapy used to treat Hodgkin lymphoma | and non-Hodgkin lymphoma | . BEAM is a high-dose chemotherapy treatment. It's given before a stem cell transplant. A stem cell transplant allows you to have much higher doses of chemotherapy.
Before or on the day you are given BEAM, a nurse or person trained to take blood (phlebotomist) will take a blood sample from you. This is to check that it is okay for you to have chemotherapy. You will also see a doctor or nurse before you have chemotherapy. They will ask you about how you have been.
The EFS was 70 % in the CY / ATG group and 47.62 % in the BEAM / ATG group, with no significant difference between them, a result that is similar to that obtained by Saiz et al.
No significant difference was seen between the 21 subjects (51.2 %) who received the BEAM conditioning regimen and the 20 subjects (48.8 %) who received the CY regimen regarding age, sex, disease presentation and EDSS scores, as shown in Table 3.
Your course of BEAM. With BEAM, the first day of your treatment is sometimes called ‘day minus seven’. This is because you will have BEAM seven days before you have the stem cells. There will be a countdown to the day you are given the stem cells, which is called day zero.
The mortality rate of HSCT for MS in studies with relatively large samples is described in Table 1. Although these studies use myeloablative conditioning regimens of varying intensity, non-myeloablative regimens have been advocated for autologous HSCT of autoimmune diseases.
Days 4-7: Etoposide (IV) & cytarabine (IV). Mini-BEAM Chemotherapy. Mini-BEAM chemotherapy is a less dose-intense regimen that can be used as salvage chemotherapy or as a preparative regimen for a stem cell transplantation. Cycle length: 28 days. Number of cycles: 2-4.
This is a prospective multicentric Brazilian MS trial comparing two conditioning regimens: BEAM / horse ATG and CY / rabbit ATG. Most (80.4 %) of the 41 subjects in the study had the secondary progressive MS subtype and the mean age was 42 years.
Cheetahs are currently listed as “vulnerable” on the International Union for Conservation of Nature red list, which monitors animal population numbers. But Panthera has called for the cats to be up-listed to an “endangered” designation as soon as possible, pointing to recent losses in areas that were home to most of the animals.
“Our findings show that the large space requirements for cheetah, coupled with the complex range of threats faced by the species in the wild, mean that it is likely to be much more vulnerable to extinction than was previously thought.”
Something about these graceful animals just makes a Cheetah’s tummy roar! Cheetahs consume an average of 6-8 lbs. of food each day, and in some cases may go as long as 4-10 days with out water. Extinction Is Forever. The Cheetah is considered Endangered in Appendix 1 to the Conservation Of International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). Humans have been proven to be the most feared predator by the Cheetah. Living space and adequate food supply is being robbed from these innocent creatures.
That number is the largest population of free-ranging cheetahs in the world, and less than half of the estimate published November 2016. As it stands, the species is officially listed as vulnerable.
The Asiatic cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus venaticus), also known as Iranian cheetah, is a Critically Endangered cheetah subspecies surviving today only in Iran. It once occurred from the Arabian Peninsula and the Near East to the Kyzylkum Desert, Caspian region, Pakistan and India, but has been extirpated there during the 20th century.
species:Jubatus. The word “Cheetah” is derived from the Hindi word “Chita” meaning “spotted one”. The Cheetah is the fastest land animal reaching speeds of 45 – 70 mph. Cheetahs have also been known to swim, although they do not like to. The Cheetah is not one of the Great Cats, because it does not have a floating Hyoid bone in its neck it can not roar, therefore it is a Lesser Cat.
The cheetah is endangered due to a combination of genetic frailties and the adverse effects of a dwindling habitat. The species has also been decimated by farmers seeking to protect their herds. ...

A stride is the measured distance between successive imprints of the same paw. With the added reach given by the spine 1 stride can stretch as far as 7-8 meters. The Cheetah averages 4 strides per second or 1 stride per .28 seconds as the horse averages 1 stride per .44 seconds and can reach top speeds of 43 mph.
Both your parents would have to be a car … rier of the gene for you to be born with Cystic Fibrosis. When two carriers of the CF gene parent a child together there is a 1 in 4 chance of the child being born with Cystic Fibrosis.   no because you don't have the other gene.
It is controlled by a recessive allele. The gene encodes a chloride ion channel that is required to make sweat, mucus and a few other things. One copy of the gene is suf … ficient to prevent cystic fibrosis, and it is only when both copies are defective that the person would have the disease and show symptoms.
Cystic fibrosis. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is one of the most common, inherited, single-gene disorders in Caucasians. About one in 3,000 Caucasian babies is born with CF. People with CF secrete abnormal body fluids.
cystic fibrosis is a recessive gene because both parents have to have the gene and pass it on so that there child can get it. this is why a child has a one in 4 chance of gett … ing the disease if both parents carry the gene because they have to get the cystic fibrosis gene from both parents.
Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disorder which affects the lungs and pancreas. It causes the lungs to get clogged with mucus, which in turn makes the lungs a breeding ground for … bacteria. In the pancreas, it blocks the pancreas from absorbing enzymes, which makes its victims prone to malnutrition.
Autosomal recessive inheritance means that the gene in question is located on one of the autosomes. These are numbered pairs of chromosomes, 1 through 22. Autosomes do not affect an offspring's gender. Recessive means that two copies of the gene are necessary to have the trait or disorder.
The defective gene that is responsible for causing cystic fibrosis is on chromosome 7. To have cystic fibrosis, a person must inherit two copies of the defective CF gene—one copy from each parent.
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disease. That means that if both parents have cystic fibrosis, so will any children that they have. If one parent has cystic fi … brosis and the other does not, then the chance drops dramatically (almost to zero).. Not wholly correct.
If both parents are carriers of the CF gene (i.e., they each have one copy of the defective gene), their child will have a 25% chance of inheriting both defective copies and having cystic fibrosis, a 50% chance of inheriting one defective copy and being a carrier, and a 25% chance of not having CF or carrying the gene.
Once parents have had a child with a recessive trait or disease, there is a one out of four, or a 25 percent, chance that with each subsequent pregnancy, another child will be born with the same trait or disorder.
Ocean resources are under intense pres-. sure to satisfy expanding demands due to population growth and globalization. Many valuable. fisheries around the world have collapsed, invasive species have disrupted marine food webs, and an increasing number of species are in danger of extinction as a result of human activi-. ties. Changes such as habitat loss and degradation pose significant threats to marine life, while.
The struggle for food is one of the most important and complex activities to occur in an ecosystem. To help simplify and understand the production and distribution of food within a community, scientists often construct a food web, a diagram that assigns species to generalized, interlinked feeding levels.

Discuss with your doctor whether any of your current medications could be lowering your blood pressure and if a change in your prescription medication regimen could help you raise your low blood pressure.
1 This can lead to a fall in blood pressure upon standing up. During this kind of quick movement your blood vessels may find it hard to adjust.  Neurological conditions: For example, Parkinson’s disease. The drugs that are prescribed to treat Parkinson’s can cause low blood pressure.
Treatment is available, if your doctor feels that there is a cause for your symptoms that can be treated. For example: If your GP suspects that a medicine you are taking is the cause of your low blood pressure, an alternative medicine may be suggested, or the dosage changed.

Avoid long, hot showers. The hot water from showers and spas can cause your blood vessels to expand, which can lead to a further drop in blood pressure. This can cause dizziness and fainting. You can remedy this by taking warm (rather than hot) showers and avoiding spas or hot tubs.
So visit your doctor, have your blood pressure checked. There are free blood pressure machines at pharmacies and grocery stores. And if the top number is ever over 140 or the bottom number ever over 90, make sure to make an appointment with your doctor as soon as possible.
Diagnosing Low Oil Pressure Causes. If you want to know how to fix low oil pressure, the initial place you should start is with your dip stick. Grab a cloth and pull out the dip stick. Give it a wipe and place it back inside. Withdraw it again and see what level of oil appears on the markers. All dip sticks will have two levels of marking.
This means that plants and crops are in danger from this type of erosion. The wind picks up loose particles, which damage the structure and stability similarly to water erosion, making it easier for later wind to pick up more particulates.

But erosion can be speeded up by such human activities as farming and mining. Erosion begins with a process called weathering; in this process, environmental factors break rock and soil into smaller pieces, and loosen them from the earth's surface. When the wind whips up a dust storm that stings our eyes, its ability to move sand is very clear. But the most powerful erosive force on the earth is not wind but water, which causes erosion in its solid form of ice and as a liquid. Water in its liquid form causes erosion in many ways. Streams from tiny creeks to huge rivers carry tons of eroded soil and rocks every year.
Soil erosion has different effects depending on the type of erosion. Water erosion leeches nutrients from the soil and lowers water quality. Wind erosion lowers air quality and damages plants. Continue Reading.

Research has shown that nearly 60% of performance horses have stomach ulcers. This is known as Equine Gastric Ulcer Syndrome (EGUS).
Brief Description. 1  Weight loss. 2  Poor body condition/hair coat. 3  Reduced appetite. 4  Decreased performance. 5  Poor attitude (girthiness, irritability, resistance, etc.) 6  Colic.
Risk factors linked to glandular ulceration in one study included: 1  NSAID use, such as Bute, given at doses 50 percent higher than recommended, and used long-term. 2  Limited turnout. 3  Horses not fed haylage. 4  Horses fed unprocessed grain. 5  Horses infrequently fed a complete diet. 6  Fast exercise on fewer days of the week.
Providing pasture turnout is the best method of preventing ulcers. The constant intake of forage and production of saliva naturally buffer the stomach against gastric acid. If fresh grass is not available or appropriate for the horse, provide free-choice grass hay.
Supplements that May Lend Support. 1  Antacids to soothe the stomach. 2  Licorice to help restore healthy stomach tissue. 3  L-Glutamine to help promote healing. 4  Soluble fiber to help form a protective layer over erosions. 5  Plant adaptogens may help horses better manage ulcer-causing stress.
Skippy may very well be suffering from ESGUS, as his current lifestyle and diet fit the typical profile of a horse likely to develop squamous ulcers. 1  These risk factors often include: 2  Limited turnout. 3  Increased feed, especially grains. 4  Rigorous exercise. 5  Frequent travel. 6  Competition. 7  Intermittent feeding.
When you order your horse's supplements on AutoShip, you're automatically* eligible for our FREE SmartPerks benefits, including: 1  Free ground shipping on what you want, when you want it. 2  10% off all SmartPak brand tack, apparel, and gear. 3  A free Team SmartPak calendar, exclusive email offers and discounts, and more!

By prioritizing your horse’s digestive health with smart management, you can ensure that Skippy is a member of the healthy performance horse minority who are free of gastric ulcers. While gastric ulcers are one of the most well-recognized conditions of the equine gut, remember that the stomach makes up just 10% of vast, complicated, and delicate digestive system.
The Differences Between Squamous Gastric Ulcers and Glandular Gastric Ulcers in Horses. Squamous Gastric Ulcers (ESGUS) in Horses.

OASIS does not allow surgical codes, V-codes, and E-codes. This raises a problem for coding for OASIS M0230/M0240 (Diagnoses and Severity Index) in most post-surgical cases where care of the surgical wound is the reason for home care admission.
According to ICD-9-CM rules, this is an instance of “multiple coding” for a single diagnosis; in this case, the agency is instructed to report separate codes in a specified order for both the etiology and the manifestation of the disease.

In the majority of cases, the decision whether to discharge a. patient from the hospital following resolution of the reason for the observation care or to admit the. patient as an inpatient can be made in less than 48 hours, usually in less than 24 hours. In only rare.
The time period varies depending on the facility. For example, the timeframe for a patient who is discharged to an acute care facility is up to nine days; the timeframe is up to 27 days for inpatient rehabilitation facility and 45 days for a skilled nursing facility.
The type of coding used and how it differs from the. acute inpatient hospital coding will be explained. Historical information. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) requires the Inpatient Rehabilitation. Facility–Patient Assessment Instrument (IRF-PAI) to be completed as part of the Inpatient.
Short stay outliers and interrupted stays in long-term care hospitals also affect reimbursement. A short stay outlier is a patient stay that has a length of stay between one day and up to and including five-sixths of the geometric average length of stay for the MS-LTC DRG.

Toxic exposures (breathing ammonia, for example) can harm the bronchi, and lead to bronchiectasis.ymptoms of bronchiectasis include constant cough and the production of infected sputum (sputum is a mixture of mucus and pus), which may be bloody. In some cases, there may be wheezing and shortness of breath.
The bronchial tubes are the networks of branching tubes which deliver air to the tiny sacs of the lungs (alveoli). In bronchiectasis, the diameter of the bronchi is unusually large.

The ability to use information technologies effectively to find and manage information, and the ability to critically evaluate and ethically apply that information to solve a problem are some of the hallmarks of an information literate individual.
Show More Show Less. - Hello, my name is Elsa Loftis, and welcome to this course on information literacy. I hope that through this course you become better, quicker, and more thorough researchers. And better students too. Through this course I hope to help you better understand the massive world of information.
Information literacy is the ability to think critically about information. It is a fundamental part of critical inquiry in the Information Age. The information literate student can: 1. Determine the extent of information he or she needs.
The Presidential Committee on Information Literacy defined information literacy as a set of skills, which require an individual to: “recognize when information is needed and have the ability to locate, evaluate, and use effectively the needed information.”(2)
Information literacy is the ability to think critically about information. It is a fundamental part of critical inquiry in the Information Age. Although the term ´information literacy´ is spreading throughout the library literature today, it is not a new idea.
“Information literacy forms the basis for lifelong learning. It is common to all disciplines, to all learning environments, and to all levels of education. It enables learners to master content and extend their investigations, become more self-directed, and assume greater control over their own learning.”(1)
Information literacy is the ability to discover and use various types of information. It's an essential skill for navigating the information age. Watch this course to learn about strategies for finding information—from a library, archive, database, or the Internet—and the ethics of using it.
Information literacy is the ability to think critically about information. It is a fundamental part of critical inquiry in the Information Age. The information literate student can: 1. 1  Determine the extent of information he or she needs.  Access the needed information effectively and efficiently.
If a student has learned how to learn, upon graduation, they are a much more attractive job candidate. An information literate individual--with their strong analytical, critical thinking and problem-solving skills--can be expected to be an adaptable, capable and valuable employee, with much to contribute.
Other characteristics of an information literate individual include the spirit of inquiry and perseverance to find out what is necessary to get the job done. We live in the Information Age, and information is increasing at a rapid pace. We have the Internet, television, radio, and other information resources available to us 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. However, just because so much information is so easily and quickly available does not mean that all of it is worthwhile or even true.

During a bowel movement, the muscles of the rectal wall contract to move stool from the rectum to the anus, a 1-inch-long opening through which stool leaves the body. The lower GI tract. Anatomic problems of the lower GI tract may involve parts of organs being in the wrong place, shaped abnormally, or incorrectly connected to other organs. Anatomic problems that affect the large intestine or anus include malrotation, volvulus, intussusception, fistula, imperforate anus, and colonic atresia.
The ascending colon is the first of four sections of the large intestine. It is connected to the small intestine by a section of bowel called the cecum. The ascending colon runs upwards through the abdominal cavity toward the transverse colon for approximately eight inches (20 cm).
These infections occur primarily in the large intestine (note some of these organisms can also infect the small intestine) and can invade the surrounding tissues. Invasion of the intestine can result in blood in the feces and cause an inflammatory response with significant numbers of fecal leukocytes.
The small intestine is a long tube that connects the stomach to the large intestine. It folds many times to fit inside the abdomen. Enlarge The small intestine connects the stomach and the colon. It includes the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. There are five types of small intestine cancer. The types of cancer found in the small intestine are adenocarcinoma, sarcoma, carcinoid tumors, gastrointestinal stromal tumor, and lymphoma. This summary discusses adenocarcinoma and leiomyosarcoma (a type of sarcoma).
The gastrointestinal tract is an organ system within humans and other animals which takes in food, digests it to extract and absorb energy and nutrients, and expels the remaining waste as feces.

A tract is a collection of related anatomic structures or a series of connected body organs. All bilaterians have a gastrointestin
On embryologic grounds, the GI tract should be divided into upper (mouth to major papilla in the duodenum), middle (duodenal papilla to midtransverse colon), and lower (mid-transverse colon to anus) according to the derivation of these 3 areas from the foregut, midgut, and hindgut, respectively.
The colon is also called the large intestine. The ileum (last part of the small intestine) connects to the cecum (first part of the colon) in the lower right abdomen. The rest of the colon is divided into four parts: • The ascending colon travels up the right side of the abdomen. • The transverse colon runs across the abdomen. • The descending colon travels down the left abdomen. • The sigmoid colon is a short curving of the colon, just before the rectum.
The sigmoid colon is the part of the large intestine after the descending colon and before the rectum. The name sigmoid means S-shaped (see sigmoid; cf. sigmoid sinus). The walls of the sigmoid colon are muscular, and contract to increase the pressure inside the colon, causing the stool to move into the rectum.

On 2 November 1868, New Zealand officially adopted a standard time to be observed nationally, and was perhaps the first country to do so. It was based on longitude 172° 30′ East of Greenwich, 111⁄2 hours ahead of Greenwich Mean Time (GMT).
New Zealand Daylight Time (NZDT) is 13 hours ahead of UTC, and Chatham Daylight Time (CHADT) 13 hours 45 minutes ahead. New Zealand dependencies, the Cook Islands, Niue and Tokelau, use several different times zones at their own discretion.
Country: New Zealand. Lat/Long: 36°51'S / 174°46'E. Currency: NZ Dollar (NZD) Languages: English, Māori, New Zealand Sign Language. Dial Codes: +64 - See how to dial
Time in New Zealand. New Zealand has two time zones. The main islands use New Zealand Standard Time (NZST), 12 hours in advance of Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) / military M (Mike), while the outlying Chatham Islands use Chatham Standard Time (CHAST), 12 hours 45 minutes in advance of UTC / military M^ (Mike-Three).

The Time Act 1974 defines New Zealand Standard Time as 12 hours in advance of UTC. In 2011, the New Zealand dependency of Tokelau moved its time zone forward by 24 hours, by skipping 30 December.
There are dependencies of New Zealand in the Pacific Ocean, in three different time zones, two of them on the other side of the International Date Line: 1  The Cook Islands are in the UTC−10:00 time zone /Military W (Whiskey) and do not observe daylight saving time.
This standard was known as New Zealand Mean Time (NZMT). In 1941, during the Second World War, clocks were advanced half an hour, making New Zealand 12 hours ahead of GMT. This change was made permanent from 1946 by the Standard Time Act 1945, at which the time at the 180°E meridian was made the basis for New Zealand Time. NZST remained half an hour ahead of NZMT, and the Chatham Islands 45 minutes ahead of NZST.

Step 2: Prepare the potatoes for baking by washing them under running water. Scrub them well, because you will be eating the skin and you dont want any mud on them. Step 3: Preheat your oven to the desired temperature. Step 4: Pierce the potatoes with a fork or knife at every side.
1. Preheat oven and wash the sweet potatoes: Preheat oven to 375°F. Scrub the sweet potatoes well and pat them dry with a dish towel. 2.

Cooking Sweet Potatoes<br /><i><b></b></i><i><b>Our sweet potato cooks give some advice:</b></i><ul><li>I usually bake a small- to medium-sized sweet potato for 40 minutes in a 350-degree oven. I usually pierce it once or twice with a fork and put foil under it while it cooks.
Baking potatoes requires a temperature range between 300 and 400F, depending upon the type of oven you use. Medium size potatoes will have to be baked for 45 minutes at 400F or for 60 minutes at 350F or 90 minutes at 325F in a regular oven. If you use convection ovens, you will have to bake the potatoes for 45 minutes at 375F or 60 minutes at 325F or 90 minutes at 300F. Convection ovens cook faster than regular ovens so the rule of thumb is to set the temperature in convection ovens at least 25F lower than you would set in a regular oven. The higher the baking temperature, the lesser the time required for baking. Baking time also depends on the size of the potatoes.
Be sure the foil is well-sealed. Place on a baking sheet and put them into the oven to roast. 4. Check for doneness: Depending on the size of your potatoes, it may take between 30 minutes to 1 hour for them to be done. Check at 30 minutes by squeezing one of the potatoes in a oven mitt protected hand and inserting a sharp knife or fork into the center. They should feel quite soft and the knife should easily glide all the way through. If not return to the oven and check again in 10 minutes. 5.

ThatTenant said... Is the impact of a car door against another car (by a person carelessly or intentionally opening the door too far), when both cars are stationary and parked in a parking garage, a collision for the purposes of automobile insurance claims? There is no statutory definition of collision.. Of course, the definition of the word collision may be irrelevant. The question is what the language of your policy says it covers. Presumably, if the policy uses the word collision, it will define that term.

Non-Silicate Minerals. Minerals can be classified as either silicate - that is, containing silicon and oxygen - or non-silicate - that is, lacking silicon. While most of the earth's crust is composed of silicate minerals, several non-silicate minerals are of great importance.
Silicates constitute the majority of Earth's crust, as well as the other terrestrial planets, rocky moons, and asteroids. Sand, Portland cement, and thousands of minerals are examples of silicates. Silicate compounds, including the minerals, consist of silicate anions whose charge is balanced by various cations.
For anion, see Orthosilicate (ion). Silicate minerals are rock-forming minerals made up of silicate groups. They are the largest and most important class of rock-forming minerals and make up approximately 90 percent of the Earth's crust. They are classified based on the structure of their silicate groups, which contain different ratios of silicon and oxygen.
A silicate is a compound containing an anionic silicon compound. The great majority of the silicates are oxides, but hexafluorosilicate ([SiF6]2−) and other anions are also included. Orthosilicate is the anion SiO4−.
While most minerals are silicates, many non-silicate minerals are found in the earth's crust and are important as well. This lesson will use examples and describe the three major groups of non-silicate minerals, including carbonates, halides and sulfates.
The main minerals found in many rocks. Silicates are composed of atoms of silicon, oxygen, and elements such as potassium, sodium, or calcium, under great heat and pressure. Silicates make up about one-quarter of the crust of the Earth.
Any of a large class of chemical compounds composed of silicon, oxygen, and at least one metal. Most rocks and minerals are silicates. Silicates are also one of the main components of bricks. 2. Any mineral containing the group SiO4 in its crystal lattice. Micas and feldspars are silicate minerals.
The Silicates. Building Blocks of The Earth’s Crust. Silicates are the most widespread of the minerals. They are made up of oxygen and silicon the number one and number two most abundant elements in the earth's crust. By themselves they make up over 90% of the weight of the earth’s crust. Most rocks are composed mainly of this class of minerals.
silicates in Science. Any of a large class of chemical compounds composed of silicon, oxygen, and at least one metal. Most rocks and minerals are silicates. Any mineral containing the group SiO4, either isolated, or joined to other groups in chains, sheets, or three-dimensional groups with metal elements.
The most abundant elements in the Earth's crust are oxygen (46.6%) and silicon (27.7%). Minerals which combine these two elements are called silicates, and combined they are the most abundant minerals on the Earth. The silicates can be organized in terms of their chemical compositions and their crystal structures (indicated by the existance of cleavage planes). They most often contain members of the Big 8 elements.
The blood pressure in each leg is divided by the blood pressure in the higher pressure of the two arms to obtain an ABI for each lower extremity. An ABI above 0.9 is normal, except when it exceeds 1.3 (an indicator of severe peripheral arterial obstruction).
Severe obstruction is also indicated by an ABI of less than 0.5. Moderate peripheral arterial disease is suggested by an ABI of 0.8. A drop in the ABI after exercise also strongly suggests peripheral arterial disease.
Post-stress ankle pressure. measurements are repeated at 1-2 minute intervals for up to 10 minutes, or until ankle pressure. measurements return to pre-exercise levels. c. If reactive hyperemia is used for stress testing, the blood pressure is likely to return to pre-stress levels. more rapidly.
The index is obtained by measuring the systolic blood pressure in the upper and lower extremities after the patient has been lying on his or her back for about 5 min and then repeating the measurements after the patient walks for 5 min. There are several ways to obtain an ABI.
Blood pressure cuffs (limb and digital) of varied width and length. Pressure artifacts occur when the cuff. size is not appropriate for the girth of the leg or digit. Recommended size is 20% wider than the diameter. of the limb.
The ratio of the angle made by the incident ray with the perpendicular (angle of incidence) to that made by the emergent ray (angle of refraction). 2. The ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum to its speed in another medium. The refractive index of water is 1.33; that of the crystalline lens of the eye is 1.413.
A measure of the efficiency of oxygen exchange by the lungs. The index is used in critical care medicine to assess the severity of acute lung injury and to gauge the effectiveness of ventilator management strategies.
Lower Extremity Arterial. Segmental Physiologic. Evaluation. This Guideline was prepared by the Professional Guidelines Subcommittee of the Society for Vascular Ultrasound. (SVU) as a template to aid the vascular technologist/sonographer and other interested parties.
The Vantage ABI is well suited for the ABI exam. The ABI is the standard exam used to assist in the. diagnosis of P.A.D. The ABI compares the systolic blood pressure at the ankles with the systolic blood. pressure at the brachial arteries.
High quality, accurate results are fundamental elements of lower extremity arterial segmental physiologic. evaluation. A combination of indirect and direct exam components is the foundation for maximizing exam quality. and accuracy.
For the first time, the music royalty fee will also be passed along to standalone SiriusXM Internet Radio subscribers. Currently, internet-only customers pay $14.99 per month for most of SiriusXM’s channels plus premium content from Howard Stern and others. Starting in January, an additional fee of $2.08 will be tacked on to the monthly bills of internet-only customers, bringing the total cost to a little over $17 per month. SiriusXM began passing along the cost of music royalties to subscribers in 2009 shortly after the merger of the two satellite radio companies.
The “per channel” cost to add individual channels to A La Carte packages has also not changed. The new maximum rate (or “cap”) for A La Carte packages is $14.99 per month. *The new rates apply to subscription purchases or renewals processed on or after January 1, 2014.
I don't LOVE guns, but I think it's pretty fun to skeet shoot, and shoot at cans. In Norway, 1,3 million guns are in civilian hands. We are 5 million citizens. That puts us in 11th place of guns per 100 citizens on a list of 179 countries according to Firearms and armed violence, country by country. There are 30 guns per 100 citizens.
Starting January 5, subscribers of SiriusXM’s top package, known as “All Access” will pay an additional $2.64 in music royalty fees on top of the base subscriber cost of $18.99 a month, an increase from the current rate of $1.87 a month.

Below is a picture showing an actual cutaway view of the forcing cone area that's inside most all shotgun barrels , notice the upper barrel is showing a lengthened forcing cone while the lower barrel is shown with a factory length forcing cone. Back to the Top. Patterns.
What is the preferred forcing cone length of Olympic medalists, anyway? Somehow, that little bit of information never seems to make the news. A forcing cone, of course, is the transition area from chamber dimension to the bore of your shotgun. The length is not really the point; it is the degree of taper. In theory, a more gentle taper is less disruptive to shot and wad.
Welcome to Johnny's Shotgun Chokes and Forcing Cones... Twenty five years ago, the most requested alteration to a shotgun barrel was screw-in choke tube installation. Twenty five years ago, the least (almost never) requested alteration to the shotgun barrel was lengthening of the forcing cone. This has all changed.
Below I will explain the forcing cone, what it does and how it can be modified to improve the performance of a shotgun. The Mysterious Forcing Cone. The forcing cone is the constriction at the end of the chamber that forces the load down from chamber size to the size of your shotgun bore.
Forcing cones. The area just forward of your shotgun’s chamber is the forcing cone; a funnel reducing the diameter of the chamber - down to bore size. An excited shooter was worried that the forcing cone area might be damaged by tough wads. Blaming plastic wads for impact is like blaming football shoulder pads for hard impacts.
Backboring is a term that is mostly misunderstood as being the forcing cone due to the fact that when working on the forcing cone area you are working on the back end of the barrel then afterwards the barrel is supposedly ''backbored'' but in reality it is the actual bore of the gun from just ahead of the forcing cone all the way through the barrel ...
Lengthen Forcing Cones To Improve Patterns, Reduce Recoil. Double-duty reamers lengthen short chambers to modern standard or magnum lengths and cut the new long forcing cone at the same time - OR - will cut a long forcing cone without lengthening the chamber for the gunsmith seeking improved shooting performance for his customer.
The 1½ long (approximately) forcing cone created is performance proven to give optimum results in any length chamber. Reamers are ground exclusively for us from special, select tool steel by one of the oldest and most respected manufacturers of reamers in the United States. Quality and performance is 100% guaranteed.

Looking at the entrance to the barrell on my 45Colt, it looks relatively ...
Nice video, but he forgot the most critical part. The forcing cone is a very misunderstood part of the revolver barrel and even many professional gunsmiths don't really understand them. THE critical dimension of a forcing cone is not the depth or angle of the cone, it's the diameter of the MOUTH of the forcing cone. That outer mouth dimension is critical.
At this time the Industrial Workers of the World had a membership of over 100,000 members. In 1913 William Haywood replaced Vincent Saint John as secretary-treasurer of the Industrial Workers of the World. By this time, the IWW had 100,000 members.
This was not true of the Industrial Workers of the World and as a result many of its members were first and second generation immigrants. Several immigrants such as Mary 'Mother' Jones, Hubert Harrison, Carlo Tresca, Arturo Giovannitti and Joe Haaglund Hill became leaders of the organization.
Chinese Immigration and the Chinese Exclusion Acts. In the 1850s, Chinese workers migrated to the United States, first to work in the gold mines, but also to take agricultural jobs, and factory work, especially in the garment industry.
The Rise of Industrial America, 1877-1900. When in 1873 Mark Twain and Charles Dudley Warner entitled their co-authored novel The Gilded Age, they gave the late nineteenth century its popular name. The term reflected the combination of outward wealth and dazzle with inner corruption and poverty.
American objections to Chinese immigration took many forms, and generally stemmed from economic and cultural tensions, as well as ethnic discrimination. Most Chinese laborers who came to the United States did so in order to send money back to China to support their families there.
The rise of industrial America, the dominance of wage labor, and the growth of cities represented perhaps the greatest changes of the period. Few Americans at the end of the Civil War had anticipated the rapid rise of American industry.
The resulting Angell Treaty permitted the United States to restrict, but not completely prohibit, Chinese immigration. In 1882, Congress passed the Chinese Exclusion Act, which, per the terms of the Angell Treaty, suspended the immigration of Chinese laborers (skilled or unskilled) for a period of 10 years.
Industrial Workers of the World. In 1905 representatives of 43 groups who opposed the policies of American Federation of Labour, formed the radical labour organisation, the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW). The IWW's goal was to promote worker solidarity in the revolutionary struggle to overthrow the employing class.
The railroads powered the industrial economy. They consumed the majority of iron and steel produced in the United States before 1890. As late as 1882, steel rails accounted for 90 percent of the steel production in the United States. They were the nation’s largest consumer of lumber and a major consumer of coal.
This finally resulted in legislation that aimed to limit future immigration of Chinese workers to the United States, and threatened to sour diplomatic relations between the United States and China.
Radiation. The principal risks associated with nuclear power arise from health effects of radiation. This radiation consists of subatomic particles traveling at or near the velocity of light---186,000 miles per second.ining uranium to fuel nuclear power plants leaves mill tailings, the residues from chemical processing of the ore, which lead to radon exposures to the public. However, these effects are grossly over-compensated by the fact that mining uranium out of the ground reduces future radon exposures.
While virtually the whole world stands against the development and use of nuclear weapons, attitudes vary when it comes to the development and use of nuclear energy. Proponents of nuclear energy tout it as a form of clean ”energy since it releases virtually none of the harmful CO2 emissions associated with fossil fuel.roponents of nuclear energy tout it as a form of clean ”energy since it releases virtually none of the harmful CO2 emissions associated with fossil fuel.
Reactor Accidents and the Release of Radioactive Materials. In a nuclear power plant, the fuel, an isotope of either uranium or plutonium, undergoes fission to produce the energy that is used to heat water and turn steam-driven turbine generators.he total number of people who died in the earthquake and the tsunami that it generated is still being assessed, but the official estimation already exceeds 14,000. 1 The natural disaster also caused substantial damage to the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, the consequences of which are still unclear.
Nuclear energy is a rare form of energy. It is the energy stored in the center or the nucleus of an atom.After we bombard the nucleus into two parts, two different elements are formed along with the emission of high energy.The process generally followed is called fission.uclear energy is a rare form of energy.

The benefits of energy production are that the use of fossil fuels  are readily available for use and it is a simple process to break  these fuels into energy. The risks ass … ociated with energy  development is that the combustion of these fields lead to  pollution which affects the environment.he major risk is the only bi products which are capable of radiating harmful radiations such as gamma rays and emitting alpha and beta particles. Otherwise it will be a great boon for the humanity to produce electrical power in a cheaper way.
Risks from reactor accidents are estimated by the rapidly developing science of probabilistic risk analysis (PRA). A PRA must be done separately for each power plant (at a cost of $5 million) but we give typical results here: A fuel melt-down might be expected once in 20,000 years of reactor operation.ining uranium to fuel nuclear power plants leaves mill tailings, the residues from chemical processing of the ore, which lead to radon exposures to the public. However, these effects are grossly over-compensated by the fact that mining uranium out of the ground reduces future radon exposures.
However, there are safety concerns that come with nuclear power, including the possibility that a nuclear power plant could accidentally release radiation into the environment or be targeted for a terrorist attack. There is also the issue of what to do with radioactive waste.In this lesson, we will explore the risks associated with nuclear power and discuss how radioactive waste is handled. Most nuclear reactors are based on the concept of nuclear fission. Nuclear fission occurs when uranium nuclei are bombarded with neutrons.he isotope U-235 is important because it can be used in the nuclear fission chain reaction to create a lot of energy. Unlike the uranium used in a nuclear bomb, which is about 90% enriched with the isotope U-235, the uranium used in a nuclear reactor is only slightly enriched, to about four or five percent.
Nuclear power can generate electricity without greenhouse gas emissions. However, there are concerns about its safety. Learn about the safety and health concerns associated with the threat of nuclear meltdowns, as well as the challenges involved in storing radioactive waste.he isotope U-235 is important because it can be used in the nuclear fission chain reaction to create a lot of energy. Unlike the uranium used in a nuclear bomb, which is about 90% enriched with the isotope U-235, the uranium used in a nuclear reactor is only slightly enriched, to about four or five percent.
The actual risk depends on several factors: 1  The specific radioactive materials, or isotopes, released, and the quantities released. 2  How a person comes into contact with the released radioactive materials (such as through contaminated food, water, air, or on the skin).n the most severe kinds of accidents, such as the Chernobyl accident in 1986, other dangerous radioactive isotopes, such as strontium-90 (Sr-90) and plutonium-239, may also be released. Human exposure to I-131 released from nuclear power plant accidents comes mainly from consuming contaminated water, milk, or foods.

Beneficiary data. The following briefly describes the different types of beneficiaries paid by Social Security. The descriptions are not meant to be definitive. Check with a local Social Security office if you believe you may be eligible for benefits. We pay benefits to the following types of beneficiaries.
A: We tend to think of Social Security benefits as going just to retired workers. But the more than 59 million Americans who receive monthly payments from Social Security include children, widows and widowers who've lost working mates, disabled people who can no longer work, and even the former spouses of breadwinners.

Social Security Disability Insurance pays benefits to you and certain members of your family if you are insured, meaning that you worked long enough and paid Social Security taxes. Supplemental Security Income pays benefits based on financial need.
Disability Benefit Types and Qualifications. There are several types of disability benefits available depending on an individuals circumstances. The best known are Social Security disability benefits. Social Security Disability (SSD) benefits are available to workers who have paid into the Social Security system through payroll deductions.
Generally, you need 10 years of work in a job in which you pay Social Security taxes to be eligible for retirement benefits. You can apply for these benefits as early as age 62 or as late as age 70, with the monthly amount going up the longer you put it off.
There are five major types of Social Security disability benefits. Social Security Disability Insurance Benefits (SSDI) is the most important type of Social Security disability benefits.

Tectonic setting The Denali-Totschunda fault is a major dextral (right lateral) strike-slip system, similar in scale to the San Andreas fault system. In Alaska, moving from east to west, the plate interactions change from a transform boundary between Pacific and North American plates to a collision zone with a microplate , the Yakutat terrane , which is in the process of being Express yourself.
McKinley Strand of the Denali Fault in the Delta River Area, Alaska ABSTRACT Offset Holocene alluvial fans and drainages along the McKinley strand of the Denali fault near the Delta River in the east-central Alaska Range indicate as much as 50 to 60 m of right- lateral displacement during the last 10,000 yrs.
Denali Fault topic. Tectonic map of Alaska and northwestern Canada showing main faults and historic earthquakes The Denali Fault is a major intracontinental dextral (right lateral) strike-slip fault in western North America, extending from northwestern British Columbia, Canada to the central region of the U.S. state of Alaska.[1]
Rupture in South-Central Alaska—The Denali Fault Earthquake of 2002 A powerful magnitude 7.9 earthquake struck Alaska on November 3, 2002, rupturing the Earth's surface for 209 miles along the Susitna Glacier, Denali, and Totschunda Faults.
The November 3, 2002, magnitude (M) 7.9 Denali Fault earthquake was the strongest ever recorded in the interior of Alaska. Like most earthquakes of its size, it was complex, consisting of several subevents. It started with thrust (upward) motion on a previously unknown fault, now called the Susitna Glacier Fault.
the Denali fault would suggest that the net vertical slip has been north side up. Recent studies by Richter and Matson (1971) along the Totschunda fault system in the eastern Alaska Range (Fig. l) and along the Denali fault near its junction with the Totschunda system produced convincing evi- GULF OF PACIFIC OCEAN Figure l.

The 7.9-magnitude 2002 Denali earthquake struck the region in November 2002. The earthquake initiated with thrust movement on the previously unrecognized Susitna Glacier fault.
Location The Denali Fault is located in Alaska's Denali National Park and to the east. This National Park includes part of a massive mountain range more than 600 miles long. Along the Denali Fault, lateral and vertical offset movement is taking place (as evidenced by many earthquakes in the region).
The 2002 Denali earthquake occurred at 22:12:41 UTC (1:12 PM Local Time) November 3 with an epicenter 66 km ESE of Denali National Park, Alaska, United States. This 7.9 M earthquake was the largest recorded in the United States for more than 48 years.
the Denali fault east of its junction with the Totschunda fault system (Fig. l) has been relatively inactive since Illinoian time and suggests that the Denali fault west of the junction has moved with the Totschunda system since about 2 m.y. ago. The Totschunda lineament may represent the trace of a new transform fault separating the North American and Pacific plates. The Denali fault system in the central Alaska Range is divided into two major strands. The northern segment, the Hines Creek fault, was first recognized and described by Wahrhaftig (1958). The other segment, 15 to 20 mi to the south, called the McKinley strand by Grantz
Many words are abbreviated in. more than one manner, sometimes in the course of a single. document. Individual commanders frequently improvise. abbreviations, which will be understandable from the. context to the German officer reading them, but may. cause considerable difficulty to the non-German.

While the Germans do not follow any consistent pro-. cedure in abbreviating, the following tendencies can be. observed: a. Whenever possible the Germans keep enough of the. original word structure to make the abbreviation a. recognizable skeleton of the word for which it stands. An example is abkdrt. for abkommandiert.

GERMAN MILITARY ABBREVIATIONS. thorough foundation in the German language is useful, but not infallible, in determining the meaning of a par-. ticular abbreviation-guessing, in this, as in all military. intelligence work, is dangerous.
(A terminological note: an abbreviation is any shortened form of a word, multi-word term, name, or phrase. Acronyms and initialisms are subcategories of abbreviations, both of which are formed from the initial parts of name. An acronym can be pronounced (e.g., NATO, OPEC), while an initialism cannot (e.g., FBI, BBC). In this article I use abbreviation to cover all three types.)
German Abbreviation Resources. The first step in understanding any abbreviation is discovering the full or expanded form. Once that has been determined, the next step is to determine whether an official, standard, or accepted translation of the full form already exists, possibly with an official, standard, or accepted acronym in English.

For this reason, the first strategy when trying to resolve a particular abbreviation is to search in a list of abbreviations for the specific domain of the source text. Then, it’s up to the translator to use knowledge of the source text, professional skill, and common sense to pick the correct full form.

The Benefits of a Weak Dollar Despite expressions to the contrary by politicos and economists, the nature of a weak dollar can actually benefit stagnated portions of our economy. For example, a weak U.S. dollar will actually help boost the manufacturing sector. A weak dollar can also help sell U.S. made goods in overseas markets at lower prices. A weak dollar will benefit a few European retailers who import Asian products bought for dollars and sell them in European markets for stronger euro payments.
Or still too weak to give up the aggregate demand benefits of a weak dollar? It’s obviously stronger than it has been, but it still isn’t strong. Normally, the answer to the above question is easy if the dollar rises because of greater competitiveness and an improving international trade balance.
The Chairman of the Federal Reserve Ben S. Bernanke has embraced a weak dollar policy. And he is not alone. The weak dollar mantra is very much in evidence on most of the boulevards and in the back alleys of Washington, D.C. The idea even has a certain appeal to the common man on the street. After all, a cheap dollar is advertised as an export stimulant and the fuel for an economic boom.
The weak dollar is good for manufacturers in the U.S., whether they're the Big Three or German or whatever, because they can export at an advantage, says Michelle Krebs, an analyst for Edmunds.com. That advantage makes the U.S. a good place to manufacture goods, and that's after decades of manufacturing fleeing abroad.
From the broad macro perspective, a stronger dollar benefits the domestic population by improving their terms of trade with the outside world. By that, economists mean we get more imports (the benefits of trade) per dollar of exports (the cost of trade). Much bad trade policy is based on the confusion over which is the cost of trade and which is the benefit.
But a major reason for the strong dollar recently is the falling Euro, Japanese yen, Australian and Canadian dollars, etc. Weaker foreign currencies are the mirror image of a stronger dollar and shouldn’t pose a problem.
Net, net, a stronger dollar is likely a headwind in a weak economy. In a stronger, fully-employed economy, a rising dollar will still act as a headwind in that it reduces total effective demand, but the benefits to consumers in particular and the population generally will likely more than offset that negative.
Weak Dollar? That's Good For U.S. Exports The dollar has been falling relative to other currencies, making buying imports more expensive in the U.S. On the other hand, it also means U.S. exports are more competitive around the world. That shift could be good news for U.S. manufacturers, especially the auto industry.
Thanks to the Fed’s weak dollar policy, the U.S. faces an inflation problem and so does the rest of the world. The weak dollar and the lack of “flexibility” — properly understood — also threaten the free flow of capital and the stability of the international monetary system.
As with most things, a balance between a strong dollar and a weak dollar is the best for our economy and stock investors. Consumers pay reasonable prices for imported goods and our manufacturers can compete in the global marketplace.

Human nature, being what it is, generally seems to cause people to want to simplify. information collection and if there is a perceived “reliable” method or test to use (even if it isn’t), they will.

Grevy's Zebra. Grevy's zebra (Equus grevyi) consumes a lot of very coarse grasses that other kinds of zebras and equines are not able to digest properly, due to the severe toughness. The bulk of the Grevy's zebra diet consists of these fibrous, tougher-textured grasses, along with forbs.
In the process we will clarify what the reason is they have stripes as well as 1  : what type of social structures they have, 2  why they can afford to be unselective grazers (i.e. not too fussy about what they eat), 3  what enemies they have in nature and what defense mechanisms they use for protection,
Other Forms of Sustenance. Although grass certainly makes up the bulk of a zebra's menu, they do occasionally eat other things. Other types of zebra foods include fruit, buds, roots, herbs, shoots and shrubs.
The zebra’s main predator or natural enemy is the lion. But other creatures attack, kill and eat zebras as well. Huge crocodiles often catch zebras when they are swimming across African rivers. Other four-legged natural enemies of the zebra, the wildebeest, and other African herbivores include leopards, hyenas and wild dogs. As for what a zebra eats, zebras are grazers. Click here to find out what that means.
Zebras are all about grazing. Karl Weatherly/Photodisc/Getty Images. The zebra is an African equine that is known the world over for its memorable black-and white-striped pattern. These hoofed creatures reside in savanna, plains and grassland areas all over Africa.
Animal Life, General Knowledge. Zebras are mammals that belong to the horse family. They are black creatures with white strips. Each zebra has a unique stripe pattern. Despite being closely related to the horse, attempts to make zebras ride-able have proved fruitless courtesy of their unpredictable nature.
Zebras in Zoos. On another hand, some zebras are under human control in places such as the zoo. These zebras apparently eat better than their wild counterparts, which is completely understandable. Zebras in zoos eat pallets specially made for herbivores, which supply them with more nutrients than hay.
Grass is the basic diet of mountain and plain zebras. It forms about 92% of their overall diets. They eat red grass, Bermuda grass that they find along the riverbeds and short grasses like common finger. Zebras also eat herbs and shrubs which constitute about 5% and 2% of their diet plan respectively.
The Burchell's zebra prefer open woodland, scrub and grassland. They will avoid dense vegetation. They are very dependent on water and you will seldom see them more than 12 km from it. The Cape mountain specie prefers the mountainous areas of the Eastern and Western Cape in Southern Africa.
The Feeding Habit. The feeding habit of zebras is a bit complex. Zebras are basically herbivores. They eat plain grass, shrubs, herbs, twigs, leaves, roots and bark from trees.
In this section you can learn more about the known causes of cancer, including genetic factors; lifestyle factors such as tobacco use, diet, and physical activity; certain types of infections; and environmental exposures to different types of chemicals and radiation.
Cancer is caused by changes (mutations) to the DNA within cells. The DNA inside a cell is packaged into a large number of individual genes, each of which contains a set of instructions telling the cell what functions to perform, as well as how to grow and divide.
Cancer is the general name for a group of more than 100 diseases. Although there are many kinds of cancer, all cancers start because abnormal cells grow out of control. Untreated cancers can cause serious illness and death.
Cancer is a broad term for a class of diseases characterized by abnormal cells that grow and invade healthy cells in the body. Breast cancer starts in the cells of the breast as a group of cancer cells that can then invade surrounding tissues or spread (metastasize) to other areas of the body.
Cancer begins in the cells which are the basic building blocks that make up tissue. Tissue is found in the breast and other parts of the body. Sometimes, the process of cell growth goes wrong and new cells form when the body doesn’t need them and old or damaged cells do not die as they should.
Cancer is a class of diseases characterized by out-of-control cell growth. There are over 100 different types of cancer, and each is classified by the type of cell that is initially affected.
Some types of cancer run in certain families, but most cancers are not clearly linked to the genes we inherit from our parents. In this section you can learn more about the complex links between genes and cancer, as well as genetic testing and how it is used.
Cancer, also called malignancy, is an abnormal growth of cells. There are more than 100 types of cancer, including breast cancer, skin cancer, lung cancer, colon cancer, prostate cancer, and lymphoma. Symptoms vary depending on the type.
Breast cancer is a kind of cancer that develops from breast cells. Breast cancer usually starts off in the inner lining of milk ducts or the lobules that supply them with milk. A malignant tumor can spread to other parts of the body.
While it is virtually impossible to tell what caused a specific person to develop pancreatic cancer, there are some important principles of cancer biology that can help us understand why pancreatic cancer develops, and large population-based studies help us understand the many risk factors for this disease.

ALS, or amyotrophic laterals sclerosis, is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects nerve cells in the brain and the spinal cord. A-myo-trophic comes from the Greek language. A means no. Myo refers to muscle, and Trophic means nourishment – No muscle nourishment. When a muscle has no nourishment, it atrophies or wastes away.

Motor neurons reach from the brain to the spinal cord and from the spinal cord to the muscles throughout the body. The progressive degeneration of the motor neurons in ALS eventually leads to their demise. When the motor neurons die, the ability of the brain to initiate and control muscle movement is lost.
For the broader group of diseases, see Motor neuron disease. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig's disease and motor neurone disease (MND), is a specific disease that causes the death of neurons which control voluntary muscles. Some also use the term motor neuron disease for a group of conditions of which ALS is the most common.
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Also known as lou gehrigs disease. It is a disease that causes progressive damage to nerves in the brain and spinal cord leading to weakness, breathing and swallowing problems. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Also known as lou gehrigs disease.
ALS is the most common type of motor neuron disease (MND); in the US, most people use the term ALS to mean MND. ALS is sometimes also referred to as Lou Gehrig's disease, after the famous baseball player who had the condition.
ALS belongs to a group of diseases called motor neuron diseases. It is a disease that attacks the nerve cells that are used in voluntary muscle actions; actions that we can control such as those in the arms, face and legs.4. As ALS progresses, motor neuron cells in the body degenerate and die.

Since the inception of the Buick brand, the Buick logo has undergone quite the transformation, going from a simple text-based insignia to a single shield derived from the Buick family’s ancestral arms, and from the first iteration of the Tri-Shield to an eagle named Happy, and then back to the modern Tri-Shield we have today.

All Buick models will adopt the new insignia by 2018. “The new tri-shield insignia represents the next chapter in Buick’s storied design history and introduces a new face for the brand,” said Duncan Aldred, vice president of Global Buick. “It’s a progressive, contemporary design reflective of Buick’s newest vehicles and cognitive of the brand’s heritage.”.

2017 Buick LaCrosse front fascia with color Tri-Shield. Today, there are two different versions of the Buick Tri-Shield logo — the variant with chrome shields used on Buick vehicles in North America, and the version that fills in the three shields in red, white, and blue on Buick in China. But that’s about to change.
There is elegant simplicity in the Avista's surfaces, which speak to the purity of the car's performance, and a timeless beauty that's a hallmark of Buick design, says Bryan Nesbitt, executive director of global Buick design —and the man charged with injecting the brand with new vigor.
As previously announced by Buick and seen in recent teaser videos, not only will the all-new, 2017 Buick LaCrosse unveil Buick’s new corporate face, but it will also replace the monochrome Tri-Shield with one that has the three shields in red, white, and blue, thereby synchronizing the logo across Buick’s two global markets of North America and China.
LOS ANGELES – Buick’s tri-shield insignia, one of the most recognizable in the global auto industry, is receiving a makeover that advances the brand’s identity while retaining Buick’s instantly identifiable symbol.
23 Comments. 1  Red white and blue all the way. 51. 2  Bring back the Hawk! 6. 11. 3  Monochrome, but must admit that the overall effect (dollar grin inspired grill, positioning of tri shield) looks premium. I just happen to like the understated post modern monochrome and how it signaled change at Buick.
The tri-shield insignia with distinctive, diagonally arranged red, white and blue shields, was widely introduced in 1960 and was featured front-and-center in the grilles of the LeSabre, Electra and Invicta models. The three-model lineup inspired the three shields in the new design. Each carried over the stag head and gold cross cues from the previous single-shield design. As with the original shield design, the tri-shield design evolved. By the early 1970s, a ring motif surrounded the shields and the white color of one of the shields changed to silver. By the late 1970s, the tri-shield was used primarily on hood ornaments on some models, while the symbol of a hawk on the Buick name was used as the official logo, particularly in print and television advertising.

The trick is to assume the value of the Earth's magnetic field and the direction of the compass. Let's assume that at this location on the Earth, the magnetic field is pointing directly North with a horizontal component of about 2 x 10-5 T. Now suppose that I do something to create a magnetic field in a known direction and perpendicular to the horizontal component of the Earth's magnetic field.
The field has always been losing energy despite its variations, so it cannot be more than 10,000 years old. We now have simple explanations for the field's origin, history, and present state. In this light, the earth's magnetic field is no longer a mystery; it is a testimony of God's handiwork.
Earth's present-day magnetic field is, in fact, much stronger than normal. The dipole moment, a measure of the intensity of the magnetic field, is now 8 x 1022 amps x m2. That's twice the million-year average of 4 x 1022 amps x m2.
of the Earth’s magnetic field at the specific location in which the experiment took place. An Earth inductor is used to perform the various components of the experiment.
The Earth's magnetic field is thought to be produced by convection currents in the outer liquid of Earth's core. The Dynamo theory proposes that these movements produce electric currents that, in turn, produce the magnetic field.
Earth's magnetic field. Earth's magnetic field, also known as the geomagnetic field, is the magnetic field that extends from the Earth's interior out into space, where it meets the solar wind, a stream of charged particles emanating from the Sun. Its magnitude at the Earth's surface ranges from 25 to 65 microteslas (0.25 to 0.65 gauss).
Best Answer: No, it changes all the time. The magnetic poles, the points at which the earth's magnetic field is perpendicular to the surface, are always on the move ...
Magnetic fields. 1  Magnetic fields arise from current flows. 2  Their strength is measured in amperes per meter (A/m). Commonly, EMF investigators use a related measure, flux density (in microtesla (µT) or millitesla (mT) instead. 3  Magnetic fields exist as soon as a device is switched on and current flows.
‘As further evidence, I used the authoritative International Geomagnetic Reference Field data—more than 2500 numbers representing the earth’s magnetic field over the whole twentieth century. The bottom line is this:
Electric fields are produced by the local build-up of electric charges in the atmosphere associated with thunderstorms. The earth's magnetic field causes a compass needle to orient in a North-South direction and is used by birds and fish for navigation.
I personally do not do Thermage. Fraxel lasts years especially if you incorporate a good skin care program after the treatments. 7 years ago by Forever Young MedSpa. After you have completed a series of Fraxel treatments it is always recommended to do a follow up every 4-6 months to maintain your results.
February 10, 2008. I hear about bad swelling & pain stories following Fraxel treatments - how do I prevent my face from swelling? I don't drink alcohol or smoke & I walk 4 miles every day & eat lots of fruits & vegetables.... Please advice me, I am beginning to be afraid. Thank you.
Fraxel is nothing like the laser treatment that tore up my arms, nor even like the laser facial-resurfacing treatments of yesteryear, which required three to four weeks of downtime hiding from your friends. Fraxel works by causing controlled micro-injury to the skin, and the magic happens during the repair process.
Step 1. Avoid using skin products such as Retin-A, Avage and retinols for at least a week before Fraxel treatment, according to the University of Missouri. You should also avoid chemical skin peels. This will ensure your skin is in the optimum state to make a speedy recovery after a Fraxel treatment.
Apply ice packs to the reddened area immediately after a Fraxel session to reduce swelling and redness. Fraxel practitioners recommend applying an ice pack for five to 10 minutes every two to three hours until the swelling subsides. Apply sunscreen twice a day after your Fraxel treatment.
Dr. Lupo has answered your question beautifully, I agree with her 100%. Smoking, drinking alcohol, and sun exposure all contribute to lessen the results of Fraxel re:pair laser treatments. I have seen both immediate as well as continued later improvement in acne scar patients following Fraxel repair. Everyone's skin and healing capability are different.
Since I recovered so quickly with relatively few issues, Dr. Weiser decided to “up the power” and also increase me to the full eight passes. For treatment two, she used the Fraxel Dual, rather than the Re:store, which can target pigmentation a bit better. For the third treatment, she went back to the Re:store. With the increased power, I had to stop her more times than during my first treatment because it hurt so much my eyes were tearing.
Dry Skin. Another one of the fraxel laser side effects is dry skin, so it is very important that you ask for product as an after-care treatment. Sometimes your dermatologist will offer products designed specifically to speed the recovery of laser treatment. There are also various moisturizers you can use as well.
If you smoke, drink alcohol, and do not use sun protection, the results will diminish quicker. It is very important that you continue to use a good sunscreen, as well as a Vitamin C serum, we like SkinCeutical's C&E Ferulic. We do recommend a touch up treatment every six months.
The nice thing about Thermage and Fraxel treatments is that they can be repeated when it becomes necessary again. I always tell my patients that if they are not going to take care of their skin why invest in cosmetic procedures. 7 years ago by LazaDerm Skincare Centre - Sioux Falls (View Profile)
The 2017 Volkswagen Tiguan ranks 11 out of 18 Compact SUVs. The 2017 Volkswagen Tiguan suffers from a lack of advanced driver assistance features, an outdated design, and some disappointing crash test scores. Additionally, it has one of the highest starting prices in its class.
Just how do you pronounce a fake word? It seems that after more than 100 years of building automobiles, the industry gets ever-more clever (or desperate) to find names for the proliferation of new models.
The name Tiguan, pronounced TEE-gwan, is a portmanteau of the German words Tiger (tiger) and Leguan (iguana) and won a naming contest by German car magazine publisher Auto Bild — from a field of names that also included Namib, Rockton, Liger, Samun and Nanuk.
How to say or pronounce Tiguan - PronounceNames.com Header. Pinky Thakkar (silent h), an engineer from Mumbai, started the Web site www.pronouncenames.com after she moved to San Jose, Calif., and mispronounced the J in San Jose, not giving it the H sound used in Spanish words ... Read More.
Volkswagen's latest ride, the Tiguan, is easier to drive than pronounce. The roomy Volkswagen Tiguan, which has a base price of $23,200, handled nicely on city streets. A car's name, in the end, doesn't matter as much as design and build quality, price, mileage, safety and performance. But Tiguan? What happened to names normal people can pronounce and remember, like Bug, Beetle or Rabbit, Volkswagen?
Pronounce Names. Pinky Thakkar (silent h), an engineer from Mumbai, started the Web site www.pronouncenames.com after she moved to San Jose, Calif., and mispronounced the J in San Jose, not giving it the H sound used in Spanish words ...
The Tiguan is made by Volkswagen, a German company headquartered in Germany. Volkswagen’s other holdings include Audi, Porsche, Lamborghini, Bentley, and Bugatti, as well as several car companies that do not sell vehicles in the United States. The 2017 Tiguan is built in Germany.
Volkswagen Tiguan. The Volkswagen Tiguan is a compact crossover vehicle (CUV) manufactured by German automaker Volkswagen. Introduced in 2007, it uses the PQ35 platform of the Volkswagen Golf. All first-generation (5N) Tiguans feature two-row seating and transverse-mounted four-cylinder engines.
Touareg required educating buyers and potential buyers on how to say it, but at least Touareg is an actual word. More than 350,000 readers weighed in on the name choice, and VW reports that Tiguan received a clear majority of the votes. The names that lost were Nanuk, Namib, Rockton, and Samun.
In the pronunciation box you'll see a play button to listen to the audioclip recorded by real people (not speech synthesis! they're Forvo users, male or female, from anywhere in the globe), the language of that word and the country of the user. Have fun! Hide.

The symptoms of pink eye may vary depending on the cause but usually include: 1  Redness or swelling of the white of the eye or inside the eyelids. 2  Increased amount of tears. 3  Eye discharge which may be clear, yellow, white or green.  Itchy, irritated, and/or burning 1  eyes. Increased sensitivity to light.  Gritty feeling in the eye.
Pink eye – or conjunctivitis – is common and spreads easily. It sometimes needs medical treatment, depending on the cause. Know the symptoms, when to seek treatment, and how to help prevent it. Pink eye, also known as conjunctivitis, is one of the most common and treatable eye conditions in the world in both children and adults.
Most cases of bacterial conjunctivitis improve quickly after starting antibiotics for pink eye treatment. Within 24 to 48 hours, redness, irritation, and eye discharge should begin to improve. Even as symptoms improve, you should continue to take your antibiotics for the full course. Allergic Pink Eye.
Many people are aware that pink eye is a highly infectious condition, but how long is pink eye contagious? People with this condition are contagious for up to 14 days, in the case of viral conjunctivitis, and up to 24 hours after an antibiotic is started with bacterial conjunctivitis. You should limit contact during this period (typically until there is no more eye discharge).
If your pink eye is caused by a common viral infection and no other complications occur, then your eyes should clear up within a few days to two weeks. Pink eye also can be caused by bacterial conjunctivitis, which — even with treatment such as prescription antibiotic eye drops — can last up to a month or longer. However, with this type of pink eye, people should no longer be contagious 24 hours after antibiotic treatment begins. Recommended For You.
Again, please discuss this with your child's pediatrician. As long as your child's doctor initially examined him, it should be known how long he should stay away from other kids. As a general rule, 24 hours after the symptoms are completely gone he probably isn't contagious anymore, but that rule is not 100%.
The conjunctiva is the clear outer lining of the eye. When it gets inflamed, the blood vessels fill with blood causing it to turn red or pink hence the name pink eye. There are many different types of conjunctivitis, but the 2 most common are allergic and viral.

The lower the mortgage rate, the more home you can afford. An adjustable rate mortgage, or ARM, makes that possible by starting out lower than a fixed rate and then adjusting over time. An ARM is a particularly attractive option when you expect changes in your financial situation over the next five years.
ARM Loan Plans: 1  3/1 ARM - The interest rate on a 3/1 ARM will remain fixed at the initial rate for the first three years. 2  5/1 ARM - Identical to the 3/1 ARM except the initial rate is fixed for the first five years.  7/1 ARM - Identical to the 3/1 ARM except the initial rate is fixed for the first seven years.
An adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) is a home loan in which the interest rate is based on an index that reflects current market conditions plus a margin that is added to the index. This index value varies and is available upon request or at application time.
In the end, choosing an adjustable-rate mortgage loan could save you money. Adjustable-Rate Mortgage Highlights: 1  Lower initial rates compared to a fixed-rate loan.  Rate/payment is locked in for the first 3, 5 or 7 years.
Based on a loan amount of $200,000 as of August 14, 2016, 25% down payment, estimated finance charges $2,150.85, and a 30 day rate lock. The loan has a 30 year maturity and APR may increase after consummation. After the initial fixed rate period (one year in our example), the interest rate may vary or increase every 12 months according to the market index.
Adjustable-Rate Mortgage - ARM. What is an 'Adjustable-Rate Mortgage - ARM'. An adjustable-rate mortgage, is a type of mortgage in which the interest rate applied on the outstanding balance varies throughout the life of the loan. Normally, the initial interest rate is fixed for a period of time, after which it resets periodically, often every year or even monthly.
An Adjustable Rate Mortgage, or ARM, generally begins with an interest rate that is 2% to 3% below a comparable fixed-rate mortgage. The interest rate may adjust to a higher or lower percentage over the life of the loan as market conditions change. Rates as low as 2.875%.
ARM Loan Plans: 3/1 ARM - The interest rate on a 3/1 ARM will remain fixed at the initial rate for the first three years. After that, the interest rate will change annually based on the value of the index plus the margin, subject to annual and lifetime interest rate adjustment caps.
Adjustable-Rate Mortgage Highlights: 1  Lower initial rates compared to a fixed-rate loan. 2  Rate/payment is locked in for the first 3, 5 or 7 years.  Capped annual and lifetime adjustments after the initial term.

Best Answer: Micronutrients are essential elements needed by life in small quantities. They include microminerals and Vitamins. Microminerals or trace elements include at least iron, cobalt, chromium, copper, iodine, manganese, selenium, zinc, and molybdenum.icronutrients are nutrients needed by life to survive, but in small quantites. These include vitamins such as iron and zinc to give a few examples. A macronutrient is the opposite, it is needed by life to survive, but in large quantities such as oxygen and carbon.

Macronutrients are elements that are needed for growth of plants in low amounts than macronutrient and these elements can be found in plants in lower amounts than macronutrients. Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn, Mo, B, Cl, Ni, are considered as micronutrients.Micronutrients are also absorbed by plant roots as ions from soil. Macronutrients may be non-mineral or mineral elements, whereas all micronutrients are minerals. • Some macronutrients are not absorbed by roots from soil such as C, H, O, whereas all micronutrient are absorbed by roots from the soil.

As stated above, your body is able to break those foods down into their chemical parts, like macronutrients and micronutrients. Macronutrients are the structural and energy-giving caloric components of our foods that most of us are familiar with. They include carbohydrates, fats and proteins.Micronutrients are the vitamins, minerals, trace elements, phytochemicals, and antioxidants that are essential for good health. The quantity and quality of these nutrients vary greatly, depending on not only what types of food you eat, but also the quality of those foods.icronutrients are the vitamins, minerals, trace elements, phytochemicals, and antioxidants that are essential for good health.

There are seven major classes of nutrients: carbohydrates, fats, fiber, minerals, protein, vitamin, and water. These nutrient classes can be categorized as either macronutrients (needed in relatively large amounts) or micronutrients (needed in smaller quantities).he micronutrients are minerals and vitamins. The macronutrients (excluding fiber and water) provide structural material (amino acids from which proteins are built, and lipids from which cell membranes and some signaling molecules are built) and energy.
3. Micronutrients There are 7 essential plant nutrient elements defined as micronutrients [boron (B), zinc (Zn), manganese (Mn), iron (Fe), copper (Cu), molybdenum (Mo), chlorine (Cl)]. They constitute in total less than 1% of the dry weight of most plants..

Vitamins and Minerals. The three macronutrients of protein, fat, and carbohydrates all perform essential roles in the human body. Macronutrients are the main components of our diet. Our bodies require others nutrients as well, such as vitamins and minerals.owever, these are needed in much smaller quantities, and thus are referred to as micronutrients. All three macronutrients are needed in the diet, as each perform vital functions in the body. 1. Protein. Protein should consist of about 10 to 35 percent of your diet.
On February 7, 2015, Jim Boyle of the Pennsylvania Record reported that the bill to amend the state constitution and raise the mandatory retirement age for Pennsylvania judges from 70 to 75 years was approved by the House Judiciary Committee.
Pennsylvania judges’ challenge to the mandatory retirement age fails before the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. In a unanimous opinion, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court dismissed the challenge of a group of county judges to the mandatory retirement age (70) for judges in Pennsylvania.
It takes two successive sessions before an amendment to the constitution goes before the citizens of Pennsylvania for a vote. Right now the bill, which would raise the mandatory retirement age for judges from 70 to 75 is in its second session.
June 17, 2013 | By Peter Hall, Of The Morning Call. Judges who challenged the Pennsylvania Constitution's mandatory retirement age should pursue an amendment to eliminate it, the state Supreme Court said Monday in throwing out their case.
The state Supreme Court Monday found that judges challenging Pennsylvania's mandatory retirement age had no legitimate claim and instead said that the proper way to change it is through constitutional amendment.
Judges who challenged the Pennsylvania Constitution's mandatory retirement age should pursue an amendment to eliminate it, the state Supreme Court said Monday in throwing out their case.
In 1968, when the mandatory retirement age was placed in the constitution, life expectancy was 70, and today it is 78, said Sen. Lisa Boscola, D-Northampton County. Pennsylvania is one of 33 states with a mandatory retirement age, typically varying from 70 to 75.
HARRISBURG — The state Senate on Tuesday took a major step toward raising the mandatory retirement age for justices and judges from 70 to 75, approving a House-passed bill to change the state Constitution. The Senate approved the bill 44-6.
April 30, 2014 | By Peter Hall, Of The Morning Call. A federal appeals court has ruled against four Pennsylvania judges, including Northampton County's Leonard Zito, who sued to overturn the state's mandatory retirement age for judges.

For example, the 2017-2018 FAFSA encompasses the following semesters: 1  Summer Session 2017. 2  Fall Semester 2017. 3  Winter Semester 2018. 4  Spring Semester 2018.
First, understand that the award letter you receive from FAFSA is an estimate. You will receive your estimated award letter 6-8 weeks after submitting your application. This estimate indicates what you are eligible for, based on the information you provided, not your actual FAFSA money. FAFSA may indicate that you are eligible for a Pell grant in a certain amount, for example. Your financial aid award is determined by the school you will be attending and their financial aid offices. While FAFSA could estimate $2,000 per semester for the above-mentioned grant, your university may only approve $1,500 of this. The same principle applies to all other government grants and loans. In turn, you will receive another document, this time from your university’s financial aid office, which outlines what you will receive in aid, should you accept it.

Best Answer: You can get pell grants and federal loans for 2 semesters per year. Summer counts as a semester, but the fafsa/academic year begins in fall. Your fall ...
Your official EFC is generated when you apply for the Pell Grant via the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA; learn more about how to submit a FAFSA here. For the 2015-2016 academic year, your EFC must be at or below $5081 to qualify for the Pell. I'll go over how to estimate your eligibility in the next section. Your enrollment status (full-time versus part-time) will also affect how much Pell Grant money you're eligible for - full-time students will get more aid than part-time students.
Award. 1  Maximum award is $5,815 per academic year; maximum award per semester is $2,908. 2  Students who received their maximum Pell Grant awards in the fall and spring, will not receive a Pell Grant in the summer.
This means you very likely will receive a $1570 Pell Grant for the full year...and $5500 as a Direct Loan. Those are the only guaranteed forms of federally funded aid you will receive. You MIGHT get other grants or scholarships...and you MIGHT get Work Study.
Your eligibility depends on your Expected Family Contribution, your year in school, your enrollment status, and the cost of attendance at the school you will be attending. The financial aid office at your college or career school will determine how much financial aid you are eligible to receive.

As a result of pressure, friction, and plate material melting in the mantle, earthquakes and volcanoes are common near convergent boundaries. When two plates move towards one another, they form either a subduction zone or a continental collision. This depends on the nature of the plates involved.
Convergent boundary. From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. In plate tectonics, a convergent boundary, also known as a destructive plate boundary (because of subduction), is an actively deforming region where two (or more) tectonic plates or fragments of the lithosphere move toward one another and collide.
Along these boundaries, magma rises from deep within the Earth and erupts to form new crust on the lithosphere. Most divergent plate boundaries are underwater (Iceland is an exception) and form submarine mountain ranges called oceanic spreading ridges.
There are basically three different types of plate boundaries (divergent, convergent, transform), and a fourth type (boundary zones) is sometimes designated when it is difficult to define a clear boundary: 1  Divergent boundaries -- where new crust is generated as the plates pull away from each other.
A subduction zone is formed at a convergent plate boundary when one or both of the tectonic plates is composed of oceanic crust. The denser plate, made of oceanic crust, is subducted underneath the less dense plate, which can be either continental or oceanic crust.
Deep ocean trenches, volcanoes, island arcs, submarine mountain ranges, and fault lines are examples of features that can form along plate tectonic boundaries. Superheated molten lava, about 2,200 degrees Fahrenheit, is about to explode into the water at the West Mata volcano along the Pacific Ring of Fire.
Deep trenches are often formed where tectonic plates are being subducted and earthquakes are common. As the sinking plate moves deeper into the mantle, fluids are released from the rock causing the overlying mantle to partially melt.
Shane Shurock and Barret Dolan Effects: The effects are deep earthquakes, an oceanic trench, a chain of volcanic islands, and the annihilation of oceanic lithosphere. The Pacific and Caroline plates form s volcanic islands and trenches.
The new magma (molten rock) rises and may erupt violently to form volcanoes, often building arcs of islands along the convergent boundary. These island arcs are always landward of the neighboring trenches. When two plates are moving away from each other, we call this a divergent plate boundary.
1 Divergent boundaries -- where new crust is generated as the plates pull away from each other. 2  Convergent boundaries -- where crust is destroyed as one plate dives under another. 3  Transform boundaries -- where crust is neither produced nor destroyed as the plates slide horizontally past each other.
Example 2. Add or subtract months to a date with Excel EDATE. Microsoft Excel provides a special function that returns a date that is a specified number of months before or after the start date - the EDATE function. It is available in modern versions of Excel 2007, 2010, 2013 and upcoming Excel 2016.
In your Excel worksheet, the formulas may look as follows: 1  To add years to a date in Excel: =DATE(YEAR(A2) + 5, MONTH(A2), DAY(A2)) The formula adds 5 years to the date in cell A2. 2  To subtract years from a date in Excel: =DATE(YEAR(A2) - 5, MONTH(A2), DAY(A2)) The formula subtracts 5 years from the date in cell A2.
Date Calculator: Add to or Subtract From a Date. This calculator enables you to add or subtract days, months and years to a date to calculate a past or future date. Recently added features.
Related Links. 1  Date/calendar related services – Overview. 2  Calendar Generator – Create a calendar for any year. 3  The World Clock – Current time all over the world.  Countdown to any date.
This formula results in the date 9/15/09. You can specify the value of the start date either by referring to a cell that contains a date value or by entering a date enclosed in quotation marks, such as 2/15/10. For example, suppose you want to add 16 months to October 16, 2009. In cell A5, type 10/16/09.
In case you want to add or subtract whole weeks to a certain date, you can use the same formulas as for adding / subtracting days, and simply multiply the number of weeks by 7: Adding weeks to a date in Excel: =A2 + N weeks * 7. For example, you add 3 weeks to the date in A2, use the following formula: =A2+3*7.
This is a discussion on How to add 6 months to a date? within the Excel Questions forums, part of the Question Forums category; Hi guys, I need a formula that will add six months to a date, while keeping the day the same. Lets say I have 10-15-11 entered in A1. I want A2 to show 4-15-12. It's important that the particular day stay the same, in this case it must be the 15th both times. Thanks! Share Share this post on.
The Microsoft Excel MONTH function returns the month (a number from 1 to 12) given a date value. The MONTH function is a built-in function in Excel that is categorized as a Date/Time Function. It can be used as a worksheet function (WS) and a VBA function (VBA) in Excel. As a worksheet function, the MONTH function can be entered as part of a formula in a cell of a worksheet. As a VBA function, you can use this function in macro code that is entered through the Microsoft Visual Basic Editor.
In the same formula, the MONTH function returns the value 6, and the DAY function returns the value 9. The DATE function then combines these three values into a date that is three years in the future — 6/9/2012. You can use a similar formula to add months to a date.
In each of the formulas, a specified number of years, months, and days are added to the date that is contained in cell A2. For example, in cell A5 (the second formula), the YEAR function is used on the date in cell A2 (6/9/2009), and returns 2009 as the year.

Not later, NOW!!! If you are shooting meth, pills, or heroin then you will need a cotton ball (paper towels, a rag, or anything like that) and witch hazel U. S. P. Astringent. You will take the witch hazel and soak the cotton ball or whatever you are using and apply it to the injection cite.
Thread: missed vein. 04-09-2002 06:47 i just injected a good shot of H, which was in about 80 or 90cc's of water. the problem is, most of it didn't make it into my bloodstream. even though initially i got a nice red cloud, the needle must have slipped out...
Btw, you will definitely still get high, but there wont' be that 'rush' (which is, at least in my opinion, the best part of injecting heroin)...but you should still feel a decent amount of opiated bliss. 06-09-2002 22:48 I learned an extremely valueable lesson earlier today when I missed my vein entirely...
Report Abuse. If you are shooting meth, pills, or heroin then you will need a cotton ball (paper towels, a rag, or anything like that) and witch hazel U. S. P. Astringent. You will take the witch hazel and soak the cotton ball or whatever you are using and apply it to the injection cite.
what to do when you miss your vein: run it under really really hot water and rub really really hard on the spot where you missed. not only will you decrease the chances of an absess forming--BUT you will also soon feel the warm rush as if you hadn't missed at all.
Drugs should only be injected into the veins. Think of the body as a road map with a highway system all its own that sends blood to and from your body parts. The map is called the circulatory system and the roads are called arteries and veins. Arteries, which usually look red, carry blood away from the heart. Veins, which usually look blue, return blood to the heart. You should never inject into an artery. If you happen to hit upon an artery by mistake, you will know if:
CARE: go to a hospital right away – this is serious; you could die! REDUCE YOUR RISK: You can do this by trying to keep dirt and bacteria out of your hit. Use a new needle, sterile water, clean cooker/and filter every time you inject. You can prevent vein damage by following the vein care tips on pages 20 and 21.
Missing The Vein. Missing. Missing (short for missing the vein) is what happens when a person shooting up isn't in a vein when they inject their shot. The the fluid that was intended for the vein ends up pooling underneath the skin or in the muscle tissue. Missing is usually an accident and not intentional.
What happens if you miss a vein when shooting up heroin. kgb answers » Health & Body » Health & Fitness » What happens if you miss a vein when shooting up heroin. Not medical advice. Shooting heroin is dangerous and missing the vein could result in blisters on the skin. Tags: blister, heroin, vein, skin.
Blood clots can form in veins throughout the body. An embolism is a free-floating blood clot moving through the veins and arteries. CAUSE: Injecting pieces of dirt or bacteria can cause clots – they get stuck in the vein and block the blood flow. Also, blood clots form around scarred veins. SIGNS could be: A clot in your arms and legs may cause pain and swelling. In your lungs it may cause chest pain, shortness of breath, unconsciousness, or death.
Courtesy of Defender. High-pressure Inflatable Floor: Like the roll-up floor, the high-pressure inflatable floor can stow easily, and setup time is super quick. The bottom of the boat has a V-shape due to an inflatable keel tube, so this style of inflatable tracks better than a flat-bottom dinghy. Due to its light weight and the hull shape, an inflatable hull dinghy can also hop on a plane with as little as a 5-horse outboard for a single rider.
How do I find and repair air leak in an inflatable boat, kayak or raft? If you are losing air pressure, (aside from pressure loss commonly caused by colder temperatures), check the boat over for air leaks. To find tiny leaks on a boat surface, fully inflate the boat until it's hard to the touch.
Small Inflatable and Plastic Pools Can Spread Illness. Small inflatable pools and plastic pools (usually 3 to 5 feet diameter) or other small water play attractions (for example, slides) have been associated with the spread of recreational water illnesses (RWIs). RWIs can be spread by swallowing or having contact with contaminated recreational water.
Steps for assembly inflatable boat with an air floor: 1  Inflate all tubes to approximately 75% full. 2  Insert boat seats in designated spots. 3  Place deflated air floor inside the boat.  Place both ends of plywood boards under the left and right sides of 1  tubes. Stretch the air floor along the boats bottom, so it covers it from nose to transom.
Before you start looking at boats, consider what your needs are, your budget, where you plan to store the boat, if you plan to tow the boat, and how you’ll power it. Inflatable-Boat Options. Roll-up Floor: If space is at a premium, an inflatable with a roll-up floor may be right for you.
Small inflatable and plastic pools are typically filled with tap water. Some people in the United States have a disinfectant in their tap water but this is not adequate to kill germs that may get into water used for swimming. Sources of information exist about how to disinfect these pools.
Clean and dry the surface of the inflatable boat thoroughly before proceeding. Create a round patch of material that has an approximate circumference of 2 (5 cm) from the centre of the hole in the inflatable boat. Use the same material of patch that the boat is constructed from for best effect.
Some inflatable boats have been designed to be disassembled and packed into a small volume, so that they can be easily stored and transported to water when needed. The boat, when inflated, is kept rigid crossways by a foldable removable thwart.
Steps for assembly inflatable boat with an air floor: 1  Inflate all tubes to approximately 75% full. 2  Insert boat seats in designated spots. 3  Place deflated air floor inside the boat. The gray plywood board should be facing the keel.  Place both ends of plywood boards under the left and right sides of tubes.
The most common term for inflatable boats is rubber boat although rubber is usually no longer used in their construction. Other terms used include inflatable dinghy, rubber dinghy, inflatable, inflatable rescue boat, and rubber duck.
By definition these materials can be harmful and should never go into your community’s regular trash. The materials listed below have commonly been referred to as household hazardous waste or HHW but are now commonly referred to as home generated special materials. These materials include: Automotive products (antifreeze, fluids, motor oil, oil filters, gasoline, polish and wax)
Latex paint is not considered hazardous waste and is not accepted at household hazardous waste (HHW) events. Unfortunately, latex paint does find its way to HHW events. In 2009, at HHW events, Montgomery County collected 188,000 pounds of latex paint and non-hazardous materials that cost $65,737 to dispose of.
Disposal Problem. The average household stockpiles 1 to 3 gallons of waste paint per year, according to several studies. In California, unless latex paint is reused or recycled, it is considered a hazardous waste and must be disposed of in a Class I hazardous waste landfill.
You can dispose of latex paint in the garbage if you dry it out it first. Here’s how. Add equal parts kitty litter to latex paint in the can (one part paint to one part kitty litter). If you have more than a half a can, you can also pour the paint into a lined cardboard box then pour in cat litter. Stir the cat litter into the paint until it has an oatmeal-like consistency that will not spill out.
Oil Based & Latex Paints. Oil-Based Paints. Oil-based paint is considered hazardous waste and must be disposed of at a Household Hazardous Waste Collection. Very small amounts of oil-based paint may be dried out using cat litter or oil spill absorbent material and placed in the regular trash.
Here’s how. 1  Add equal parts kitty litter to latex paint in the can (one part paint to one part kitty litter). 2  Stir the cat litter into the paint until it has an oatmeal-like consistency that will not spill out. 3  Allow the paint and cat litter mixture to sit for one hour.  Throw the dried paint in the can in the garbage with the lid off.
The solvent keeps the paint in a liquid form until the solvent evaporates after the paint is applied. The. solvent in oil-based paint is derived from a petroleum distillate and can include such hazardous. ingredients as mineral spirits, toluene and xylene. The solvent in latex paint is water.
Household Hazardous Waste. PAINT DISPOSAL. Paints commonly used in households: Water-based: latex - least harmful, pre-1992 paint may contain mercury; Oil-based: enamel, lacquer, shellac and varnish - contains solvents; Hobby or artist: coloring paints - may contain solvents or heavy metals; Aerosols: spray paints - contain solvents and propellants.
Paint. 1  Paint and varnish are the most common household products that become household hazardous waste. 2  By diverting latex paint from household hazardous waste collections, Montgomery County could save valuable tax payer dollars and perhaps provide additional services or events.
Management of leftover paint, such as disposal and household hazardous waste (HHW) collection, is discussed in another fact sheet, Latex Paint: Hazards and Solution for Disposal. Save on Disposal. Landfilling is an unnecessary expense because leftover paint, in most cases, is still a usable product.
Cells undergoing aerobic respiration produce 6 molecules of carbon  dioxide, … 6 molecules of water, and up to 30 molecules of ATP  (adenosine triphosphate), which is directly used to produce energy,  from each molecule of glucose in the presence of surplus oxygen.
Cellular respiration is the process of oxidizing food molecules, like glucose, to carbon dioxide and water. C6H12O6 + 6O2 + 6H2O → 12H2O + 6 CO2. The energy released is trapped in the form of ATP for use by all the energy-consuming activities of the cell.

Cellular respiration 3. Glycolysis Glycolysis is a metabolic pathway that is found in the cytoplasm of cells in all living organisms and is anaerobic(that is, oxygen is not required). The process converts one molecule of glucose into two molecules of pyruvate, itmakes energy in the form of two net molecules of ATP.
This process starts in the cells’ cytoplasm and is completed in the mitochondria-the cellular powerhouse. In those tiny organelles, one molecule of glucose with 6 molecules of oxygen are changed into 36 molecules of ATP – the energy cells can use to get things done.
Cellular Respiration begins with a biochemical pathway called GLYCOLYSIS. This is a process in which one molecule of glucose is broken in half by enzymes in the cytoplasm, producing 2 molecules of pyruvic acid and only 2 molecules of ATP. Glycolysis releases a relatively small amount of the energy stored in glucose.
Cellular respiration is the process of using oxygen in the mitochondria to chemically break down organic molecules such as glucose to release the energy stored in its bonds. In the process molecules of water and carbon dioxide are released as waste products.
The aerobic respiration of a molecule of glucosereleases more energy than the anaerobicrespiration of a molecule of glucose because, inaerobic respiration,(1) carbon dioxide is used (2) more chemical bonds are broken (3) oxygen is released(4) lactic acid is formed6.
Now, another part that I want to highlight on the head of the femur is this depression right here that is used for the attachment of this ligament that is cut right here. This is the head of the femur ligament.
Subtrochanteric fractures are located between the lesser trochanter and the femoral isthmus that is, in the proximal part of the femoral shaft. They are less common than femoral neck and intertrochanteric fractures, accounting for approximately 5% to 15 % of hip fractures.
Now, the acetabulum, as I mentioned, is a cavity formed by the synostosis of these three bones. So this is the meeting point of these three bones: the ilium, the pubic bone, and of course, the ischium. Now, still on the acetabulum, I want to add something important here that this is the socket for the hip joint.
Femoral Neck Fractures The femoral neck is the most common location for a hip fracture, accounting for 45% to 53% of hip fractures. Per 100,000 person years, approximately 27.7 femoral neck fractures occur in men and 63.3 occur in women.
Part Position of the Lateral Femur distal and mid shaft. Pt. is in lateral recumbent position. Flex knee 45* with patient on affected side and align femur to midline of IR, placing unaffected leg behind affected, to prevent rotation. Include knee joint and take a 2nd radiograph for the hip.
As you know, the hip joint is a ball-and-socket joint, and for that matter, you’re going to have a ball portion. That is the head of the femur as you can see here. And of course, the socket portion where this head will attach will, then, be the acetabulum.
Now, moving on to another part, the largest portion of the femur, this is known, of course, as the body or the shaft of the femur. Moving on to the next one, this time, we’re going to talk about the neck of the femur. And this is the portion that you find between the head right here and this other portion that we’re going to talk about next known as the greater trochanter.
Now, on the posterior side, you find, as well, another line, let’s say, but this time called the intertrochanteric crest that is also between the neck of the femur and the shaft and runs, as well, from the greater trochanter all the way down to the lesser trochanter.
The femoral neck is the region of the femur bounded by the femoral head proximally and the greater and lesser trochanters distally (shown below). A femoral neck fracture is intracapsular, that is within the hip joint and beneath the fibrous joint capsule.
And the very first thing you need to know about the hip bone, it’s also comprised of three bones. Three bones... or the hip bone consists of three bones. The first one is this one that you can see here. It’s highlighted in green like all our training units and all our tutorials.
Derek Cianfrance wrote the script based on the town his wife Shannon Plumb grew up in, Schenectady, NY. The film was mostly filmed there on location. The phrase Place Beyond the Pines is actually the Native American meaning to the word Schenectady..
Director Derek Cianfrance claims that he would not have made the movie without Bradley Cooper cast as Avery Cross. In fact, he drove five hours to Montreal (QC) to meet with Cooper in person to convince him to take the role.
Luke (Academy Award nominee Ryan Gosling) is in constant motion, a high-wire motorcycle stunt performer who travels from town to town with the carnival. Passing through Schenectady in upstate New York, he tries to reconnect with a former lover, Romina (Eva Mendes), only to learn that she has in his absence given birth to their son Jason.

You might need to deregister iMessage if you have a non-Apple phone and can't get SMS or text messages someone sends you from an iPhone. This can happen if you used iMessage on your iPhone and then transferred your SIM card or phone number to a non-Apple phone (such as Android, Windows, or BlackBerry).If you recently switched from using an iPhone and didn't turn off iMessage, your number is still sending iMessages, not SMS or text.f you still have the iPhone you were using before you switched, use it to deregister iMessage with these steps. 1  If you transferred your SIM card from the iPhone to a non-Apple phone, put it back in the iPhone.

It has something to do with the phone trying to send texts as an iMessage. It is related to the new IO7 release. I set my phone to send either as an iMessage or a text. This is something you have to do manually in settings.

Myrrh is a common resin in the Horn of Africa. An essential oil extracted from myrrh (Commiphora myrrha). Myrrh /ˈmɜr/ from the Hebrew 'מור' (mor) and Arabic مر (mur) is the aromatic resin of a number of small, thorny tree species of the genus Commiphora, which is an essential oil termed an oleoresin.Myrrh resin is a natural gum.yrrh gum, like frankincense, is such a resin. When people harvest myrrh, they wound the trees repeatedly to bleed them of the gum. Myrrh gum is waxy, and coagulates quickly. After the harvest, the gum becomes hard and glossy.
Myrrh gum is commonly harvested from the species Commiphora myrrha, which is native to Yemen, Somalia, Eritrea and eastern Ethiopia. Another commonly used name, Commiphora molmol, is now considered a synonym of Commiphora myrrha.yrrh gum, like frankincense, is such a resin. When people harvest myrrh, they wound the trees repeatedly to bleed them of the gum. Myrrh gum is waxy, and coagulates quickly. After the harvest, the gum becomes hard and glossy.
Commiphora mukul, a related species, is not a source of myrrh. Myrrh is used to make medicine. Myrrh is used for indigestion, ulcers, colds, cough, asthma, lung congestion, arthritis pain, cancer, leprosy, spasms, and syphilis.It is also used as a stimulant and to increase menstrual flow.Myrrh is applied directly to the mouth for soreness and swelling, inflamed gums (gingivitis), loose teeth, canker sores, bad breath, and chapped lips.It is also used topically for hemorrhoids, bedsores, wounds, abrasions, and boils. In foods and beverages, myrrh is used as a flavoring component.t is also used as a stimulant and to increase menstrual flow. Myrrh is applied directly to the mouth for soreness and swelling, inflamed gums (gingivitis), loose teeth, canker sores, bad breath, and chapped lips.
Both frankincense and myrrh are derived from the gummy sap that oozes out of the Boswellia and Commiphora trees, respectively, when their bark is cut.The leaking resin is allowed to harden and scraped off the trunk in tear-shaped droplets; it may then be used in its dried form or steamed to yield essential oils.oth frankincense and myrrh are derived from the gummy sap that oozes out of the Boswellia and Commiphora trees, respectively, when their bark is cut.
Frankincense, also called olibanum, is an aromatic resin used in incense and perfumes, obtained from trees of the genus Boswellia in the family Burseraceae, particularly Boswellia sacra (syn: B. carteri, B. bhaw-dajiana), B. frereana, B. serrata (B. thurifera, Indian frankincense), and B. papyrifera.rankincense resin is edible and is used in traditional medicines in Africa and Asia for digestion and healthy skin. For internal consumption, it is recommended that frankincense be translucent, with no black or brown impurities.
It is an aromatic resin obtained from trees of the genus Boswellia  and used to make incense and perfume.  Answer:  Frankincense is also referred as olibanum. It is an arom … atic  resin acquired from genus Boswellia trees (Boswellia  sacra).This is a common source to make perfume and incense.aking the world better, one answer at a time. Yes, frankincense is edible. But it must be pure frankincense which should be translucent and light yellow in colour, with no black or brown impurities. It is commonly chewed like gum.

Deep mycoses are caused by primary pathogenic and opportunistic fungal pathogens. The primary pathogenic fungi are able to establish infection in a normal host; whereas, opportunistic pathogens require a compromised host in order to establish infection (e.g., cancer, organ transplantation, surgery, and AIDS).The primary deep pathogens usually gain access to the host via the respiratory tract.he primary pathogenic fungi are able to establish infection in a normal host; whereas, opportunistic pathogens require a compromised host in order to establish infection (e.g., cancer, organ transplantation, surgery, and AIDS).
Opportunistic Fungus Infections are caused by organisms that are inherently of low virulence, and disease production depends on diminished host resistance to infection. Common etiologic agents of opportunistic infections are Aspergillus, Candida, Rhizopus, and Cryptococcus.. |. |. In true pathogenic fungus infections, the fungus is virulent regardless of the constitutional adequacy of the host.
These infections are called “opportunistic” because they take advantage of your weakened immune system, and they can cause devastating illnesses. OIs are signs of a declining immune system.

How to build a simple legless corner desk with wood flooring panels. I demonstrate how I constructed a custom desk from surplus wood flooring and scrap materials. The resulting desk build is simple, functional, and elegant.
When you think practically, there’s no need to pay hundreds of dollars for a desk when you can make your own one for under $30. Here’s how: Use (9 cm) wide CLS for the main frame (legs and one support) and some 60mm (6cm) CLS timber for the supports that will be visible.
1 A corner desk is space saving and fits in different room layouts, but you’ll be stuck facing a corner, usually with your back to the door. 2  Straight desks are the most common and versatile for placement (against a wall or in the middle of the room). 3  They don’t always offer the most surface space, however.
1. Run a stud finder along the wall on both sides of the corner. Locate all of the studs on both sides to a distance of 32 inches on the left and right from the corner, and mark the locations. Measure up from the floor, and make marks on both sides of the wall at 28 inches.
The successful use of permanent percutaneous femoral nerve stimulation using a stimulating lead placed close to the femoral nerve with the aid of ultrasound guidance has been reported. Surgical
If nerve stimulation is used (0.5 mA, 0.1 msec), the passage of the needle through the fascia iliaca and contact of the needle tip with the femoral nerve usually is associated with a motor response of the quadriceps muscle group.
The Femoral Nerve. The femoral nerve is one of the major peripheral nerves of the lower limb. In this article, we shall look at the anatomy of the femoral nerve – its anatomical course, motor and sensory functions, and any clinical relevance.
The femoral nerve is one of the largest nerves in your leg. It’s located near the groin and controls the muscles that help straighten your leg and move your hips. It also provides feeling in the lower part of your leg and the front of your thigh.
The largest nerve that emerges from the lumbar plexus is the femoral nerve, which descends beneath the inguinal ligament before dividing into a number of smaller branches innervating the anterior thigh musculature and skin . One pure sensory branch, the saphenous nerve, continues down the medial leg to the arch of the foot.
Femoral nerve block with local anesthetic and steroid is occasionally used in the treatment of persistent lower extremity pain when the pain is thought to be secondary to inflammation or when entrapment of the femoral nerve as it passes under the inguinal ligament is suspected.
The femoral artery is a very large artery that lies close to the femoral nerve. In trauma they are often injured together. Injury to or bleeding in the artery can cause compression on the nerve. Additionally, because the femoral nerve provides sensation to a major portion of the leg, injuries can occur due to this loss of sensation.
In the thigh, the nerve lies in a groove between iliacus muscle and psoas major muscles, outside the femoral sheath, and lateral to the femoral artery. After a short course of about 4 cm in the thigh, the nerve is divided into anterior and posterior divisions, separated by lateral femoral circumflex artery.
Mononeuritis multiplex is the femoral nerve dysfunction due to systemic disorder of femoral nerve. Entrapment of femoral nerve also damages myelin sheath or axons (nerve fibers). Due to this the impulses are not passed on properly via nerve. If pelvic bone is broken, femoral nerve can get damaged.
The femoral nerve is present in leg and provides assistance in the leg straightening action. Sensation to the thigh front and lower leg is provided by femoral nerve. Pelvic fracture is the major problem associated with this nerve. In case the femoral nerve is damaged, it is indicated by weakness in leg or impaired movement or sensation of leg. Recovery is possible if the exact reason for femoral nerve dysfunction is diagnosed.

Futuristic: The cigarette inhaler is being touted as a viable alternative. The brainchild of Chinese inventor Hon Lik, these were battery-powered plastic cylinders made to look like the real thing, which contain a small vaporiser which delivers a puff of nicotine (but no tar) to the lungs when sucked.
Without doubt, smoking remains a risky business. In the U.S. alone, tobacco kills more than 440,000 people each year, according to the CDC. Yet most experts concur that no matter how strong your will for kicking the habit, there are some powerful, addictive forces plotting against you.
When it comes to smoking cessation, there's no magic bullet -- I think everyone agrees with that, says Thomas Kiresuk, PhD, a clinical psychologist at the Minneapolis Medical Research Foundation and former director of the Center for Addiction and Alternative Medicine Research in Minneapolis, Minn.
Pharmacokinetics of nicotine. Pharmacokinetics refers to what the body does to a substance, while pharmacodynamics refers to what a substance does to the body. After inhaling tobacco smoke, nicotine rapidly enters the bloodstream, crosses the blood-brain barrier and is inside the brain within eight to twenty seconds.
But there are two crucial differences which BAT believes will set it apart and make it the first truly safe cigarette. Principally, the nicotine dose will be higher. And second, BAT is in talks with the MHRA to have their devices licensed as an officially approved tobacco substitute. Alex Hearne says BAT plans to submit its product to the MHRA to secure its status as an officially regulated product next year.
But it's one of the best things you can do for your health. Smoking is a dangerous, even deadly habit. It's a leading cause of cancer. It also increases your risk for heart attacks, strokes, lung disease, and other health problems, including bone fractures and cataracts. If nicotine lozenges, patches, chewing gum, counseling, and other smoking cessation methods haven't helped you kick the habit, don't give up.
All this has led many tobacco firms - fearful of losing revenue - to ponder an alternative, described as the -'safe cigarette'. This new cigarette, which will satisfy nicotine cravings without the danger of lung cancer, emphysema or heart disease, has achieved almost mythical status in the industry. Although big tobacco firms have been working on 'healthy smoking' for 50 years, the technical and economic hurdles have been too high.

Transcript of Vacuoles, Vesicles, and Cytoskeleton Defined. Cytoskeleton The Cytoskelton is a network of protein filaments. that gives a eukaryotic cell its shape and support. Its main functions are: It supports the cell and maintains shape. It controls the positions and movements of organelles within the cell.
Some freshwater protists have contractile vacuoles, a specialized form of vacuole that they use to manage water balance within the cell by pumping out excess water. Plant cells have very large vacuoles which function in storing nutrients and water within the cell. They can also serve a structural function by helping the plant cell to retain its shape through turgidity. Vesicles typically function through transportation of compounds within and between cells. Often, the substances within a vesicle will be cellular products or byproducts of a cells functioning. Typically vesicles function in much the same way in all cells. Vacuoles serve a variety of functions depending on the cell in which they are found. In most animal cells where vacuoles occur, they function in the temporary storage of food substances.
Do white blood cells have vacuoles or vesicles? White blood cells have vesicles, which transport molecules in and out of the cell. It is plant cells which have the vacuoles which maintains cell stability.
outside of the cell wall (endocytosis). 3. Enzyme Storage: Vesicles can hold and store enzymes used throughout the cell. e.g. enzymes that are used to make plant cell walls. 2. Metabolism: Vesicles can act as chemical reaction chambers. The membrane of vesicles harbor reactions from the cytosol in the cell allowing the reactions to take place.
In a plant cell the vacuole is much larger than the animal cells vacuole. The plant cells vacuole mostly contains water. In the animal cells vacuole it is used to store waste. … Animal cells do not have vacuoles. Only plant cells
Vesicles and Vacuoles Vesicles and vacuoles are membrane-bound sacs that function in storage and transport. Vacuoles are somewhat larger than vesicles, and the membrane of a vacuole does not fuse with the membranes of other cellular components. Vesicles can fuse with other membranes within the cell system (Figure 1).
The contractile vacuole enlarges as water enters then abruptly contracts, forcing the water out of the cell through a special pore structure. Vacuoles work with the cell membrane to move materials in and out of the cell. They also work with the lysosomes of a cell to digest cellular materials. Vesicle Vacuoles are basically vesicles filled with mostly water. A vesicle is a small bubble in a cell. This bubble is similar to a plasma membrane, consisting of a lipid bi-layer.
2. Structure: In many plant cells, enormous vacuoles take up more than 90 percent of the cell volume and grow as the cell grows. The presence of dissolved substances in the vacuole causes water to enter it from the cytoplasm, making the vacuole swell like a water-filled balloon.

Rub each trout generously with olive oil and sprinkle with sea salt; sprinkle inside of cavities with salt and black pepper. Place half the lemon and onion slices into cavity of each trout, along with minced garlic, and place a sprig of rosemary and thyme into cavities.
Dip fish in milk and coat with flour. Dip again in milk, and then dredge fish in the breadcrumbs mixture. Place fish on a greased baking sheet. Bake, uncovered at 450 degree for 4-6 minutes per ½-inch thickness or until fish flakes easily when tested with a fork.
Preheat your oven to 400 F. Rinse the fish and pat it dry with clean paper towels. Grease a baking dish with a nonstick cooking spray and lay the speckled trout in the middle of the dish. The spray will help prevent the fish from sticking to the dish and make removal of the fish easier when cooking is complete. Step 4. Brush the fish with a mixture of butter, thyme, rosemary, black pepper and tarragon.
If cooking in an oven, pre-heat oven to 350 degrees. After you have rolled up the trout, you have to measure its thickness. Cook for 10 minutes plus an extra 10 minutes for each inch of thickness. If you stuff a 4-pound trout, it will be about 3 inches thick so you would cook it for 40 minutes. Another good way to bake a trout is to chop up an apple and a large white onion and put into a pan and fry with some salt and butter.
Once you catch ‘em, you got to eat ‘em! Here are a few delicious recipes to prepare with that freshly caught Speckled Trout you worked so hard for. Baked Speckled Trout. Prep: 15 minutes.
A 2 to 4 pound trout is usually the best size to bake. Trout that are bigger should be let go as they are the breeders. Place the trout on the fire grill or barbeque. Don't have the trout close enough to the fire that it burns but you do want it to be hot.
made it | 14 reviews. Recipe by: Trina Cosgrave. Whole trout stuffed with herbs and flavorings, then grilled directly on grates, produces flavorful, flaky, tender fish with tasty crispy skin.. Featured in Allrecipes Magazine — Subscribe!
After 40 minutes, you can place the trout off to the side while you cook some steaks, which by the way, goes great with baked trout. At this time, the trout is cooked but it's OK to keep it warm by the fire for another ten minutes while you cook other stuff.
A man prepares speckled trout on a baking tray in his kitchen. Trout is a mildly flavored, oily fish that holds up well when cooked in the oven. To keep the fat and calorie content low, avoid baking the fish in heavy sauce or using an excessive amount of butter or oil during cooking.
Turn preheated grill down to low and place the trout directly onto the grill; cook until flesh flakes easily and the skins are browned, 6 to 7 minutes per side, flipping once.

Bremsstrahlung (or Brems) radiation. is one of the two kinds of x-rays produced at the tungsten target of the x-ray tube; The incident high-speed electron, passing through a tungsten atom, is attracted by the positively charged nucleus and therefore is deflected from its course, with a resulting loss of energy.
High-energy x-. ray photons have a greater probability of penetrating matter, whereas relatively low-energy photons have a greater probability of being absorbed. Therefore the higher the kVp and mean energy of the x-ray beam, the greater the penetrability of the beam through matter.
X-rays can be produced by a high-speed collision between an electron and a proton. Light can take on many forms. Radio waves, microwaves, infrared, visible, ultraviolet, X-ray and gamma radiation are all different forms of light. The energy of the photon tells what kind of light it is. Radio waves are composed of low energy photons. Optical photons--the only photons perceived by the human eye--are a million times more energetic than the typical radio photon.
This results in an increased efficiency of conversion of electron energy into x-ray photons, and thus an increase in 1) BThe number of photons generated ~ Be eww aa rre iinn BBooardd EExxaammss 2) Their mean energy. 3) Their maximal energy.
The x-ray photons are either absorbed or scattered out of the beam. In scattering, photons are ejected out of the primary beam as a result of interactions with the orbital electrons of absorber atoms. In the case of a dental x-ray beam, three mechanisms exist where these interactions take place.
In radiation protection, the product of absorbed dose and the correct modifying factor (rad x QF) is used to determine. rem (Sv) Rem (dose-equivalent) is the only unit of measurement that expresses the dose-effect relationship. The product of rad (absorbed dose) and the quality factor appropriate for the radiation type is expressed as rem or DE (dose equivalent), and may be used to predict the type and extent of response to radiation.
classical scatter, a low-energy photon interacts with an atom but causes no ionization; the incident photon disappears into the atom, and is then immediately released as a photon of identical energy but changed direction.
X-Rays-Another Form of Light. The photons themselves can also collide with electrons. If the electrons have more energy than the photons, the collision can boost the energy of the photons. In this way, photons can be changed from low-energy photons to high-energy photons.
The closer the high-speed electron approaches the nuclei, the greater is the electrostatic attraction on the electron, the braking effect, and the greater the energy of the resulting Bremsstrahlung photon. Bremsstrahlung interactions generate x-ray photons with a continuous spectrum of energy. i.e. different energies.
The HVL is the thickness of an absorber, such as aluminum, required to reduce by one half the number of x-ray photons passing through it. As the average energy of an x-ray beam increases, so does it HVL. The term quality refers to the mean energy of an x-ray beam. Half value layer measures the intensity of a beam.

For round rings measure the horizontal inside diameter of the ring at the. widest point. When measuring D-rings, take the perpendicular dimension. from the point where the ring exits from the metal base to the inside of. the top of the ring. HOW MANY PAGES WILL A BINDER HOLD - (BASED ON 20# BOND PAPER) ROUND RING.
submitted 1 year ago by gaynx. My name is Onyx (very new to reddit please forgive me!) i really just need some help! I'm not sure how to measure for a gc2b binder! it's my first binder and i'm very scared to mess this up! photos or guides would be super appreciated. 3 comments.
SIZE OF YOUR BINDER- The size of our binder depends on your sheet size. Binder size is always. measured by the size sheet the binder will hold. Most binders are made to hold 11” x 8 1/2” or. 8 1/2” x 5 1/2” sheets. Always list the binding edge of your sheet first.
D-Ring Binders hold up to 25% more paper than a Round Ring. The ring is mounted to the back cover so pages lie flat. The number of pages of paper (sheet capacity) that a binder can hold depends on the size of the binder (that’s the ring size measured as inches) and the type of ring style.
Measure around your chest just below the swell of your breast. Make certain the measuring tape is snug, but not constricting. This measurement is your underbust, as shown by the red line in the diagram. Now measure around the fullest part of your breast. The tape should be loose-fitting, as when measuring for a bra. This number is your topbust. Subtract your underbust size from your topbust size. This number will give you your cupsize, according to the chart below.
6. sohoeva: Every binder at this site has a different size chart. Pick the binder you want, then click on the size chart. You’ll find the button to get to the chart down near the bottom of the page, where there are other pictures of the binder for you to click on and enlarge. One of those pictures is the size chart.
For example: 5 tabs = 20 sheets, which would be deducted from the above total number of sheets. For larger binders, you can approximate the number of sheets by calculating from the totals above. For example, a 2 binder can hold up to 500 sheets of 24# bond, and a 1 binder can hold 250 sheets. Therefore, a 3 binder would be needed to hold up to 750 sheets.
Ring binder size (1″, 2″, etc.) is measured based on the size of the ring, not the width of the binder spine. The overall size of the rings must be larger than the stated inch-size because the ring must go around the contents in order for you to close it. Round Ring (also called O-Ring)
your binder: Measure along the straight edge of the ring, as indicated by the red arrow. Do not include any of the curved part of the ring. Capacities are in 1/4 to 1/2 increments, ande may be as much as 1/8 variation, depending upon manufacturer. For number of sheets. per capacity, see chart below.
Go, on the underworks site, to the specific binder that you want. You’ll see something that looks like this: “ Size - fits Chest: x-small 29-31 / Small 32-34 / Medium 35-39 / Large 40-44 / X-large 45-48 / 2X 48-52 / 3X 53-56”. Your average measurement should be within the range of your size.

LOCATION: There are two types of rainforest biomes: temperate and tropical rainforests. Temperate rainforests are found along coasts in temperate regions. The largest temperate rainforests are on the Pacific coast in North America, stretching from Alaska to Oregon.ropical rainforests are lush and warm all year long! Temperatures don’t even change much between night and day. The average temperature in tropical rainforests ranges from 70 to 85°F (21 to 30°C). The environment is pretty wet in tropical rainforests, maintaining a high humidity of 77% to 88% year-round.
A tropical rainforest is a biome type that occurs roughly within the latitudes 28 degrees north or south of the equator (in the equatorial zone between the Tropic of Cancer and Tropic of Capricorn).ther parameters that affect tropical rainforests are carbon dioxide concentrations, solar radiation, and nitrogen availability. In general, climatic patterns consist of warm temperatures and high annual rainfall. However, the abundance of rainfall changes throughout the year creating distinct wet and dry seasons.

He incorporated Biltmore and opened the house to visitors for the first time in 1930. Edith died in 1958, and in 1960 the Cecil sons split the Biltmore property. George took the dairy and a portion of the estate, while William took the house and the part of the estate known as Biltmore Forest. William became head of the Biltmore Company and a leading historic preservation advocate. Although the U.S. government has declared Biltmore a National Historic Landmark, it operates without federal grants

To provide healthy-lifestyle education, a quality program of physical education must be a core requirement in all schools and a central component in a comprehensive school health program (Allensworth & Kolbe, 1987). Our first step might be to consider ways to increase curriculum time devoted to physical education.
Physical education is a course taught in school that focuses on developing physical fitness and the ability to perform and enjoy day-to-day physical activities with ease. Kids also develop skills necessary to participate in a wide range of activities, such as soccer, basketball, or swimming.
In Australia, physical education was first made an important part of the curriculum in Government primary and secondary schools in 1981. The policy was outlined in a Ministerial Statement to the Victorian Legislative Assembly by the Minister for Educational Services, the Fat Norman Lacy MP on 17 September.
Definition of Physical Education. Kids, as well as adults, benefit from regular exercise. Health benefits from regular exercise include: stronger muscles and bones, increased coordination and energy, and decreased risk of developing chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes. For most kids, exercise means being physically active during play, recess, and physical education class, also known as P.E.
A physically educated person. 1  Demonstrates competence in many movement forms and proficiency in a few movement forms; 2  Applies movement concepts and principles to the learning and development of motor skills; 3  Exhibits a physically active lifestyle;  Achieves and maintains a health-enhancing level of physical activity;

physical education:- it basically means knowledge for exercise physical-body... so that's why it is called a s physical education.. body exercises by playing, running nd doing activities which can make ur physic be better or Flexible. Nancy · 12 months ago.
of or relating to the body: physical exercise. 2. of or relating to that which is material: the physical universe; the physical sciences. 3. noting or pertaining to the properties of matter and energy other than those peculiar to living matter.
Meaning pertaining to matter is from 1590s; meaning having to do with the body, corporeal is attested from 1780. Meaning characterized by bodily attributes or activities is attested from 1970. Physical education first recorded 1838; abbreviated form phys ed is from 1955. Physical therapy is from 1922.
Rethinking how we teach physical education can help students lead healthy lives. Regular physical activity provides numerous health benefits—from leaner bodies and lower blood pressure to improved mental health and cognitive functioning.

Process theories of motivation are based on early cognitive theories, which posit that behavior is the result of conscious decision-making processes. The major process theories of motivation are expectancy theory, equity theory, goal-setting theory, and reinforcement theory.
Sign In | Sign Up. Process theories explain how workers select behavioral actions to meet their needs and determine their choices. The following theories each offer advice and insight on how people actually make choices to work hard or not work hard based on their individual preferences, the available rewards, and the possible work outcomes. Equity theory.
This has been an important theory in the history of the study of motivation. This theory highlights that motivation is partly a decision-making process that evaluates effort for outcomes. It highlights the involvement of the active cognitive processes and user choice in the process.
Process (or cognitive) theories of motivation focus on conscious human decision processes as an explanation of motivation. The process theories are concerned with determining how individual behavior is energized, directed, and maintained in the specifically willed and self-directed human cognitive processes.
The Process Theories of Motivation. Whereas the content theories concentrate on the question of 'what' motivates, the process theories address more the issues relating to how the process works and sustains itself over time, such as factors that determine the degree of effort, the continuation of effort, the modification of effort, etc.
Content (or need) theories of motivation focus on factors internal to the individual that energize and direct behavior. In general, such theories regard motivation as the product of internal drives that compel an individual to act or move (hence, motivate) toward the satisfaction of individual needs.
Equity Theory. Equity Theory within Process Theory measures work motivation by the amount of skills an employee possesses and the efforts of the employer. When an employee feels that she and her employer have made equal investments in each other, she is more likely to feel motivated.
The Equity Theory of motivation is a process theory that explores an individual’s motivation to work based on the fairness or sense of equality he detects in the relationship, comparing the amount of effort he puts into any given situation to the benefits he is receiving.
Using process theory, a type of scientific observation, individuals measure how events in a specific process lead to an outcome. According to this theory, when a company wants to reproduce an outcome, the company must duplicate the process used to derive this objective.
Process theories of motivation. The group of motivational theories that falls under the umbrella category of Process Theories of Motivation is based on the use of our rational thought processes or cognitive processing abilities.
Often going along with depression in many individuals, anxiety is also one of the more prevalent mental health problems among the elderly. Anxiety disorders encompass a range of issues, from obsessive-compulsive disorder (including hoarding syndrome) to phobias to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The Facts About Mental Illness in the Elderly. You might not be surprised to read that the most common mental health issue among the elderly is severe cognitive impairment or dementia, particularly caused by Alzheimer’s disease (National Alliance on Mental Illness).
The study also showed that common geriatric conditions were strongly associated with disability and difficulty in performing normal activities of daily living, such as bathing, dressing, eating, and going to the bathroom, even after adjusting for other chronic diseases.
Aug. 6, 2007 -- Half of U.S. adults over age 65 suffer from at least one common age-related condition, according to a new study. But researchers say these highly treatable geriatric health problems are often overlooked by health care providers.
Heart disease. Heart disease is common in senior cats also. There are many different types of heart disease. One of the most commonly seen in cats is cardiomyopathy, a disease of the heart muscle. Degenerative valvular disease and other types of heart disease can be seen as well.
Chronic renal (kidney) disease. Disease affecting the kidneys is a common affliction in older cats. Essentially, the kidneys act as a filter system, removing many of the waste products produced by your cat’s body. Once filtered from your cat’s blood, these waste products are eliminated via the urine.
Social Issues and Seniors. Social circumstances can have a significant impact on physical and mental health of seniors. These are some of the common factors impacting the overall health of older individuals. Addressing these issues makes comprehensive care of the elderly complex and multi-dimensional.
Researchers say most older adults with common geriatric health conditions live in the community rather than in nursing homes and are not under the care of a geriatrician. An approach to their care that included the identification and management of geriatric conditions is needed, write the authors.
Cognitive health is focused on a person’s ability to think, learn and remember. The most common cognitive health issue facing the elderly is dementia, the loss of those cognitive functions. Approximately 47.5 million people worldwide have dementia—a number that is predicted to nearly triple in size by 2050.
1. Chronic health conditions. According to the National Council on Aging, about 92 percent of seniors have at least one chronic disease and 77 percent have at least two. Heart disease, stroke, cancer, and diabetes are among the most common and costly chronic health conditions causing two-thirds of deaths each year.

Breaking a Lease and Leaving Early. Landlords must take reasonable steps to rerent the place if you break a lease (you won't always be on the hook for rent for the remainder of the lease term). A lease lasts for a fixed term, typically one year, then simply ends of its own accord at the end of the term.
1 stay on as a month-to-month tenant with your landlord’s approval (in most states, the terms and conditions of the old lease (such as no pets) will carry over into your new, oral month-to-month tenancy), or.  face an eviction lawsuit if you attempt to stay when the landlord wants you to move on.
A few state laws list other reasons that allow tenants to break a lease, for example because of a job relocation or family health problems. If you have a good reason for a sudden move, check your state law to see whether or not you are still on the hook for rent for the remaining lease term.
At this point, you must either: 1  move. 2  sign a new lease, with the same or different terms,  stay on as a month-to-month tenant with your landlord’s approval (in most states, the terms and conditions of the old lease (such as no pets) will carry over into your new, oral month-to-month tenancy), or.
Online services like leasetrade.com, leasetrading.com, or swapalease.com allow you to advertise your lease to prospective buyers. People who are looking to get out of a lease are matched up with people who want to take over the lease for the remainder of the term. These services can be useful, but exercise caution and check the monthly advertising fees and any other out-of-pocket expenses you may incur.
You can also find another buyer to assume the lease in a lease assumption transaction. This transfers the contract and liability to someone else. Check with your lessor before you pursue this option because the new lessee may need to meet certain requirements to be qualified to take over the lease.
I need to break my lease because I can't afford to pay it anymore? Boston, MA | July 8, 2012 3:10pm. I have been told by management that if I do break the lease I have to keep paying it every month until they rent it to someone else. Is that fair? And the reason why I'm breaking the lease is because I can't pay it and the monthly payment is $ 1575 a month.
Keep in mind that not all leasing companies allow lease assumptions. This takes us back to step one—consulting your lease contract. You must examine your specific lease stipulations before going through a lease assumption or any other lease-termination process. Be aware of the consequences of whatever action you take.
Posted July 8, 2012 5:41pm. You cant get blood out of a rock... If you cant pay, you cant pay. Attorney Varszegi is correct, the landlord must mitigate their damages and there may be illegal provisions in the lease that would allow you to break a lease. You need leverage if they don't want to play nice.
I will have to see if I can see my breath when the temperature is 45. The thing I like learning about was that our breath has tiny water droplets. I also did not know that when it's 45 degree outside, you can see your breath I thought that you can only see your breath when it's really cold outside, like 32 degrees.
Marilyn: You wrote, “You can see your breath only in winter because the colder the air, the less moisture it can hold (warm air can always hold more water vapor than your breath can).” (February 17, 2013) The season has some relevance, but you can actually see your breath condensate in summer if the temperature and relative humidity are low enough, ...
I think what we might be looking for here is the difference in temperature between the exhaled breath and the ambient air temperature...Sure, after a big gulp of hot coffee warms your mouth, you can see steam at 80F.
If the temperature of the air is equal to the dewpoint, it's foggy. So, sure, if the air temperature is less than the dewpoint of your breath, that's how you get foggy breath. But it has little to do with the dewpoint of the air around you.
The three main factors that play into this are temperature, relative humidity, and pressure. Another factor are the particles in the air that allow the vapor to condensate on them, e.g. dust. You can even see your breath condensate at room temperature if the conditions are met. All that is required is that the exhaled air has to be saturated with humidity to reach a point of about 5 percent above the relative humidity of the air in the room.
When you exhale when it's cold outside, the water vapor in your breath condenses into lots of tiny droplets of liquid water and ice (solid water) that you can see in the air as a cloud, similar to fog.
When exhaled, air mixes with cold air, the temperature of the exhaled air drops, but there is more water vapour. When the air becomes saturated, (relative humidity is 100%), the extra water vapour will condense, allowing you to see your breathe on cold days.
When exhaled, air mixes with cold air, the temperature of the exhaled air drops, but there is more water vapor. When the air becomes saturated, (relative humidity is 100%), the extra water vapor will condense, allowing you to see your breathe on cold days. 12 people found this useful.
As a rule of thumb, the temperature must be below 50 degrees (F) to see one's breath. The phenomenon is dependent on a number of criteria, including pressure and humidity. It is possible to make one's breath visible at room temperatures by partially pressurizing your exhaled breath.
There's no exact temperature at which condensation will occur. Many environmental factors other than temperature can play a role in condensation, including relative humidity (the amount of moisture in the air). When it falls below 45° F (7.22° C), though, you can usually expect to be able to see your breath.

Cranberry Twp tornado leaves 1-mile stretch of damage. CRANBERRY TWP, Pa - A tornado that touched down in Cranberry Township Saturday afternoon only traveled a mile before it lifted off the ground, but that was all it needed to leave a path of damage in its wake.
Avocados are an excellent source, along with organic raw butter, coconut oil, and organic pastured eggs, just to name a few. There's also evidence suggesting that limiting your intake of protein can be helpful for long-term good health and the prevention of cancer.
A small pilot study found that eating one-half of a fresh medium Hass avocado with a hamburger significantly inhibited the production of the inflammatory compound Interleukin-6 (IL-6), compared to eating a burger without fresh avocado.
In the article we take an in-depth look at the possible health benefits of eating avocados as well as a nutritional breakdown of the avocado. To maintain balance, we will also look at the possible health risks of consuming avocados.
Indoors, an avocado tree is usually grown from the pit of an avocado fruit. This is often done by removing the pit from a ripe, unrefrigerated avocado fruit. The pit is then stabbed with three or four toothpicks, about one-third of the way up from the flat end. The pit is placed in a jar or vase containing tepid water.
While avocado is commonly eaten raw, on salad or alone, with nothing but a dash of Himalayan salt and some ground pepper, for example, there are many other ways to include avocado in your diet. For example, you can use avocado in the following ways: Use as a fat replacement in baking.
6 Things You Probably Didn't Know About Avocados. You know they make a killer eggocado and are beloved among guacamole aficionados. You might also know you can feel good eating one, thanks to healthy fats and loads of nutrients. But the mighty powers of the avocado stretch farther than you probably realize. 1. An Avocado Is A Fruit, And More Specifically A Berry You might be inclined to call it a vegetable, thanks to its green hue and savory taste, but the avocado is technically a fruit, and even more specifically, a single-seeded berry.
Nutritional perks aside, avocados can play a key role in your healthy hair and skin routine. The antioxidants, amino acids and essential oils inside an avocado can help repair damaged hair, moisturize dry skin, treat sunburns and maybe even minimize wrinkles, HuffPost Style reported.
Avocados, which are actually classified as a fruit, are rich in monounsaturated fat that is easily burned for energy. Personally, I eat a whole avocado virtually every day, which I usually put in my salad. This increases my healthy fat and calorie intake without seriously increasing my protein or carbohydrate intake.
For example, you can use avocado in the following ways: 1  Use as a fat replacement in baking. Simply replace the fat called for (such as oil, butter or shortening) with an equal amount of avocado.  Use as a first food for babies, in lieu of processed baby food.
Avocados: Health Benefits, Nutritional Information. Avocados are a stone fruit with a creamy texture that grow in warm climates and are often a feature of Mexican and South American cuisine. Also known as an alligator pear or butter fruit, the versatile avocado is the only fruit that provides a substantial amount of healthy monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA). Avocados are a naturally nutrient-dense food and contain nearly 20 vitamins and minerals. This MNT Knowledge Center feature is written by MNT's qualified nutritionist and forms part of a collection of articles on the health benefits of popular foods.
Uber-smooth northern delights. Georgian Bay, part of the great Lake Huron, the shores of which sustain Parry Sound, birthplace of Bobby Orr, is now home to a new, intrepid and, yes, accomplished distillery.

A large bay that protrudes northeast from Lake Huron into Ontario, Canada, is called Georgian Bay. A notable feature of the lake is Manitoulin Island, which separates the North Channel and Georgian Bay from Lake Huron's main body of water. It is the world's largest lake island. Major centres on Georgian Bay include Owen Sound, Wasaga Beach, Collingwood, Midland, Penetanguishene, Port Severn and Parry Sound.
It drains Lake Couchiching and Lake Simcoe . The river flows generally northwest into Georgian Bay , a large bay of Lake Huron . The Severn forms part of the inland canal system known as the Trent-Severn Waterway , which links Port Severn on Georgian Bay with Trenton on Lake Ontario via the Trent Canal .
Georgian Bay, northeast arm of Lake Huron in southcentral Ontario. It is shielded from the lake by the limestone spine of the Niagara Escarpment, which extends in a great arc northwest up the Bruce Peninsula.
After a short delay at the pump-out dock, Andiamo headed out of Midland and towards Beausoleil Island that is part of the Georgian Bay Islands National Park. The wind created a very manageable one foot chop that flattened out after getting behind Present Island.

Lake Huron, second largest of the Great Lakes of North America, bounded on the west by Michigan (U.S.) and on the north and east by Ontario (Can.). The lake is 206 mi (331 km) long from northwest to southeast, and its maximum width is 183 mi.
Nature expresses Emerson's belief that each individual must develop a personal understanding of the universe.

Emerson is in many ways a process philosopher, for whom the universe is fundamentally in flux and “permanence is but a word of degrees” (CW 2: 179). Even as he talks of “Being,” Emerson represents it not as a stable “wall” but as a series of “interminable oceans” (CW3: 42).
Transcendentalism does not recognize either the Trinity or God as a person. God is deemed to be closer to the Atman (Hindu conception), the universal soul or spirit, which is beyond human personality. Nature: Emerson first sought an answer to the question of the place of man in a science of nature. His essay, Nature, was published in 1836, and is the main text by Emerson and about transcendantalism. It is divided into 8 parts.
Emerson asserts and reasserts the underlying unity of distinct, particulate expressions of the divine. In the Introduction, he emphasizes man's and nature's parallel positions as manifestations of the universal order, and consequently as means of understanding that order.

This Is Why Marijuana Should Be Legal Everywhere. A Gallup poll released on Tuesday reveals that for the first time in history, Americans are more in favor of legalizing marijuana than criminalizing it. 2013 has markedly been a successful year for marijuana legalization, with Colorado and Washington both passing laws to decriminalize the drug.
With the majority of Americans agreeing that marijuana should be legalized, we’ve gathered up eight reasons why those who are still on the fence about the natural plant should possibly reconsider their feelings. It’s time to legalize! No one has ever died of a marijuana overdose.
As you can see from a 2010 study published in the Lancet and reported on by the Economist, a team of drug experts in the U.K. assessed the combined harms to others and to the user of marijuana as less than the harms posed by alcohol or tobacco use.
Marijuana is becoming more and more ubiquitous every year despite being less addictive than coffee. There's a reason people are feeling safer and safer trying the drug, which brings us to our next point... Marijuana is much safer than already legalized drugs.

With Colorado and Washington legalizing the plant’s recreational use, Uruguay edging towards having the first regulated and government-owned cannabis industry, and this week’s launch of a billion-dollar medical cannabis industry in Canada, it is essential for the pros and cons of policy reform to be more widely acknowledged.
Why Marijuana Should Be Legalized. Weed is illegal almost everywhere in the world while it's the 3rd most popular recreational drug. That's kind a contradiction. Legal weed would make the world without a doubt a better place to live. Pot Law wants weed to be legal all over the world. No exceptions, and ideally today.
Around 40% of Americans have already admitted to using marijuana. Most polls regarding Americans and their pot use hover around the 40% mark for having tried marijuana at least once. This is compared to the 16% of Americans who have tried cocaine, which is obviously a significantly lower percentage.

Therefore, the labor cost of installing a new machine is considered to be part of the asset's cost and not an immediate expense of the period. The cost of the installation labor will include the workers' wages and the fringe benefits applicable to those wages.
Cost breakdown. Selecting the carpet - carpeting can cost as little as $2 per square foot, or as high as $100 per square yard, but the average carpet and pad 1 will cost between $30 and $40 per square yard - for a total of around $995 for the carpeting alone.
Fence installation costs vary by material. Top-rated fencing pros tell Angie's List that, based on the average price for material type, and a typical fence length of 200 linear feet, here’s what you can expect to spend: • $2,600 for chain-link, at $13 a foot. • $3,200 for wood, at $16 a foot.
Installing Your Wood Floors - Cost Factors. Installing hardwood flooring costs between $250 and $7,000, but the total price will vary depending on many factors. Some of those factors include what kind of flooring you decide to install, its quality or grade and how complex the installation job will be for a professional.

A number of factors influence the cost of a fence installation including type of materials used, the size, and if you hire a professional to install it. Installing a fence or adding to an existing fence may be a project you can tackle on your own.
If weaknesses are discovered, the repairs must be made in advance of the carpet installation. This might mean that the carpenter will install new joists or plywood 3 before the carpet pad 1 or tack strips are installed. Carpenters require roughly $70 per hour, and plywood 3 sheets of 4'x8' cost only $22 each.

Yield to maturity is a useful measure of the attractiveness of a seasoned bond that is held to maturity and redeemed at par value. For example, suppose you buy a $1000 par value ABC Company bond with a 5% coupon rate maturing in five years, and the market price for the bond is $900.
The coupon rate is the annual interest the bond pays. If a bond with a par value of $1,000 is paying you $80 per year, then the coupon rate would be 8% (80 ÷ 1000 = .08, or 8%). Years to maturity: The number of years remaining before the bond reaches its maturity date. The maturity is the date the par or face value of the bond is returned to the bond holder.
This yield to maturity calculator assumes that the bond is not called prior to maturity. If the bond you're analyzing is callable, use our Yield to Call (YTC) calculator to determine the bond’s value. What it Means... If you buy this bond today, you will earn 10.63% per year. If the bond you’re analyzing is callable, you should use the Yield to Call (YTC) calculator.
Bond Yield to Maturity Calculator. Instructions: Enter the current price of the bond, the par value, the coupon rate, and the number of years to maturity, then click the Calculate Yield to Maturity button. Mouse over the blue question marks for a further explanation of each entry field.
Let's say the annual interest paid is $50. The current yield of the bond is the interest divided by the current price of the bond, which in this case is $50/$900, or 5.56%. On redemption of the bond after five years, you get the face value of $1000 for the matured bond and realize $100 in capital gain. Yield to maturity takes into account both interest and capital gain return on the bond and is calculated using the following steps. Ad.
The coupon rate is the annual interest rate the issuer will pay on the amount borrowed. For example, if a bond has a par value of $1,000 and a coupon rate of 8%, then you will receive annual coupon (interest) payments of $80 (1000 X .08 = $80) until the bond's maturity date. Most bonds make coupon payments semi-annually, so you would likely receive a $40 coupon payment two times each year.

For example, if you can buy a bond with a $1,000 face value and 8% coupon for $900, and the bond pays interest twice a year and matures in 5 years, enter 1,000 as the Face Value, 8 as the Annual Coupon Rate, 5 as the Years to Maturity, 2 as the Coupon Payments per Year, and 900 as the Current Bond Price.
To calculate a bond's yield to maturity, enter the face value (also known as  par value ), the coupon rate, the number of years to maturity, the frequency of payments and the current price of the bond.

For example, if the absorbance reading is 1, extend the line from this absorbance point on the Y axis (a): At the point of intersection, extend a vertical line to the X axis and read the corresponding concentration (b). Samples that have an absorbance value falling out of the range of the standard curve.
All Answers (4) 1  First, you should have a high value in wells with the antibody added but no competing antigen (or vice versa, as these assays can be done with either antigen or antibody coated on the well). 2  Hi Mohammed, 3  Hi Mohammed,  Sorry to be late in my reply.
If you have software such as Prism 6.0, you can select from a variety of linear and non-linear curve fitting methods. This software will also give you the formula for the line, and you can use that formula and the value obtained with the unknown to calculate the concentration in the unknown based on its absorbance.
3. Concentration of target protein in the sample. To determine the concentration of target protein concentration in each sample:  First find the mean absorbance value of the sample. From the X axis of the standard curve graph, extend a horizontal line. from this absorbance value to the standard curve.

Hi Mohammed, you can only derive a protein concentration from a competitive ELISA under very special circumstances. If you are not sure whether you have these conditions in your experiment you should work with IC50 values.
This will provide enough data for statistical validation of the results. Many computer programs are now available to help process ELISA results in this way. Calculate the average absorbance values for each set of duplicate standards and duplicate samples. Duplicates should be within 20% of the mean.
Podcast topic. 1  Overview of the SimpleStep ELISA® protocol. 2  Which sample type to use. 3  How to set your plate layout and draw the standard curve.  Calculate the PD-L1 concentration.
Standard curve range. Typically, an ELISA measures protein concentrations in the range of 0.1-1 fmole or 0.01-0.1 ng, however this is dependent on the antibody-antigen interaction. Therefore, a classic standard curve ranges from 0-1000 pg/ml, although some can go as high as 3000 pg/ml if the samples to be measured are concentrated.
Calculate the concentration of each sample by using the average of the duplicate/triplicate samples for x in the equation. If the concentration of the sample exceeds the highest point of the curve or does not lie within the linear range of the curve, then dilute the sample prior to measurement.
Dr. Phil’s Marriage Has Hit A Rough Patch. 11/08/2012 2:52 PM ET | Filed under: Love Line • Dr. Phil • For Reals Estate. It looks like there’s trouble on Dr. Phil island! The TV host has been having some marital probz with his wife, Robin McGraw and even a $30 million mansion can’t fix it!
She was surprised, frankly, that it took so long. She is, after all, Dr. Phil's first wife, the ex-cheerleader he married Nov. 27, 1970, at Southridge Presbyterian Church in Roeland Park, Kan. That's Phillip C. McGraw, the TV psychologist Oprah made famous.
When his classmates tell people they went to high school with Dr. Phil - and they do so proudly - people often don't believe them. In his first book, Life Strategies, McGraw wrote that when he was a teenager, he moved here with his father, who was on an internship in psychology. McCall remembers that McGraw did not want to be here. Daddy made him come up here because he wanted to keep an eye on him, she said.
The couple has been together for 36 years, and we would hate to see them split up! Hopefully Dr. Phil can take some of his own advice and apply it to his marriage. [Image via Ray Filmano/WENN.] Tags: 30 million dollar mansion, divorce, dr phil, marital problems, marriage, robin mcgraw.

The film does so through the focus of another genre, the personal documentary. Its main character—its virtual auteur—is Bill Genovese, one of Kitty’s three younger brothers, who was sixteen at the time of her murder; he was her favorite brother, and the two were very close.
Moseley, who was denied parole for a seventeenth time in December 2013, remains in prison as of March 2015; aged 78 at the time of his most recent parole hearing, he is currently one of the longest serving inmates in New York State.
Catherine (Kitty) Genovese, 5 feet 1 and 105 pounds, was stabbed eight times in the chest and abdomen and four times in the back and she had three cuts on her hands-probably inflicted as she tried to fight off her attacker near her apartment in an alleyway, at 82-70 Austin St., at Lefferts Blvd., Kew Gardens.
It took forty years for Bill—and he alone, among the members of Kitty’s family—to look behind the headlines and try to find out for himself how so many of her neighbors managed to hide their heads and ignore her agony.
Genovese, 19 at the time and a recent graduate of Prospect Heights High School in Brooklyn, chose to remain in the city, where she had lived for nine years. At the time of her death, she was working as a bar manager at Ev's Eleventh Hour Sports Bar on Jamaica Avenue and 193rd Street in Hollis, Queens.
1 Kitty Genovese's murder inspired folk singer Phil Ochs to write the song  Outside of a Small Circle of Friends , originally released on the album Pleasures of the Harbor (1967).
By Richard Brody. The 1964 murder of Kitty Genovese, who is pictured here at her grandparents’ home in Brooklyn, is the subject of James Solomon and Bill Genovese’s documentary “The Witness.” Credit PHOTOGRAPH COURTESY THE GENOVESE FAMILY / FIVE MORE MINUTES PRODUCTIONS.
Genovese had driven home from her job early in the morning of March 13, 1964. Arriving home at about 3:15 a.m., she parked in the Long Island Rail Road parking lot about 100 feet (30 m) from her apartment's door, located in an alleyway at the rear of the building.
Winston Moseley (born March 2, 1935), at that time a 29-year-old man from South Ozone Park, Queens, was apprehended by police during a house burglary six days after Genovese's murder.

I've recently come across different chicken recipes that call for either madeira wine or marsala wine. Just wondering what the difference in taste is between the two wines. am not a wine expert, but if I remember right, Madiera is Portugese and Marsala is from Marsala, Italy. I think they call them both fortified wine, whatever that means...Madiera is heated or cooked somehow before bottling~maybe even before aging..

The idea behind this is quite simple. You give up part of your salary and, in return, your employer gives you a non-cash benefit, such as childcare vouchers, or increased pension contributions. Once you accept a salary sacrifice, your overall pay is lower, so you pay less tax and National Insurance.alary sacrifice is when you agree to give up part of your salary so you can get extra benefits from your employer. Find out more about how it works. How salary sacrifice works. Things to consider before taking salary sacrifice.
Your employer might offer a salary sacrifice pension scheme to all salaried workers on the payroll. This type of pension scheme is voluntary, but it may be to your advantage if your financial circumstances are right.otential Disadvantages. It seems at first glance that participating in a salary sacrifice pension scheme is a good deal for workers. However, it is not always the best option. To begin with, a worker must be confident that the lower salary will be enough to sustain his or her monthly budget.
Salary sacrifice is an especially tax-efficient way for you to make pension contributions.ou may also benefit from more pension contributions from your employer, if they are giving you some or all the money they are saving on NICs. But you need to weigh up four disadvantages against this too. 1  If your employer is providing you with life cover, this is usually worked out as a multiple of your salary.
Take the example of an employee, earning £40,000 per annum, paying 5% into their pension. If this was done via salary sacrifice, the employer would save 13.8% of what was sacrificed, which is £276 p.a. (based on 2012/13 tax rates and assuming the scheme is contracted-in).Multiply this out for 300 employees, and the saving becomes approximately £83k each and every year the scheme runs.lthough salary sacrifice is not a new idea, it has grown in popularity in recent years as more employers take advantage of the tax and national insurance savings they can generate. Our research indicates that the vast majority of UK companies with employee benefits in place have implemented a salary sacrifice scheme.

Obesity, also called corpulence or fatness, obesityRay Pietro—Photonica/Getty Imagesexcessive accumulation of body fat, usually caused by the consumption of more calories than the body can use. The excess calories are then stored as fat, or adipose tissue.
At their most basic, the words “overweight” and “obesity” are ways to describe having too much body fat. The most commonly used measure of weight status today is the body mass index, or BMI. BMI uses a simple calculation based on the ratio of someone’s height and weight (BMI = kg/m2).
Obesity traditionally has been defined as a weight at least 20% above the weight corresponding to the lowest death rate for individuals of a specific height, gender, and age (ideal weight).
Globally, there are 1.5 billion adults who are either overweight or obese, a number expected to increase to 3 billion by 2030. The epidemic is reaching catastrophic proportions, and one of the key-if small- steps to bringing it under control is to have a common language to describe the problem.

obesity: Body Mass Index for adultsEncyclopædia Britannica, Inc.Obesity was traditionally defined as an increase in body weight that was greater than 20 percent of an individual’s ideal body weight—the weight associated with the lowest risk of death, as determined by certain factors, such as age, height, and gender.
More recent guidelines for obesity use a measurement called BMI (body mass index) which is the individual's weight multiplied by 703 and then divided by twice the height in inches. BMI of 25.9-29 is considered overweight; BMI over 30 is considered obese.
The treatment of obesity has two main objectives: removal of the causative factors, which may be difficult if the causes are of emotional or psychological origin, and removal of surplus fat by reducing food intake. Return to normal body weight by reducing calorie intake is best done under medical supervision.
Obesity is an abnormal accumulation of body fat, usually 20% or more over an individual's ideal body weight. Obesity is associated with increased risk of illness, disability, and death. The branch of medicine that deals with the study and treatment of obesity is known as bariatrics. As obesity has become a major health problem in the United States, bariatrics has become a separate medical and surgical specialty.

This Elderberry Syrup Recipe is a great way to keep your family healthy and happy while saving pennies too! Elderberries (also know as sambucus or sambucol) have long been used in folk medicine to prevent and treat the symptoms of the common cold and flu. These tiny purple-blue berries are rich in anti-oxidant flavinoids and anti-inflammatory anthocyanin.
Pregnant and breastfeeding women should not take elderberry. If you have an autoimmune disease, such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus, you should ask your doctor before taking elderberry, as it may stimulate the immune system.
In the Wikipedia entry on elderberries, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elderberry, it says: I'm going to try the elderberry tea. Then I'll know it's cooked, and I can control the amount of sugar, if any, in it.

Elderberry, or elder, has been used for centuries to treat wounds, when applied to the skin. It is also taken by mouth to treat respiratory illnesses such as cold and flu. In many countries, including Germany, elder flower is used to treat colds and flu.
Drugs that suppress the immune system -- Because elderberry may stimulate the immune system, it could interfere with medications taken to suppress the immune system. These medications include corticosteroids (prednisone) and medications used to treat autoimmune diseases.
There's impressive medical research on the effectiveness of elderberry in strengthening the immune system and helping to combat influenza, etc. But I can't find anything on its safety during pregnancy; everything seems to have the usual disclaimer, if pregnant or nursing, consult your physician..

The terms formative and summative do not have to be difficult, yet the definitions have become confusing in the past few years. This is especially true for formative assessment. In a balanced assessment system, both summative and formative assessments are an integral part of information gathering. Depend too much on one or the other and the reality of student achievement in your classroom becomes unclear.
Each element may be rated on a1 to 5 scale, with 5 representing the highest level of proficiency. Questionnaires-A questionnaire is a self-report assessment device on which students can provideinformation about areas of interest to the teacher.
Summative assessments are typically used to evaluate the effectiveness of instructional programs and services at the end of an academic year or at a pre-determined time. The goal of summative assessments is to make a judgment of student competency after an instructional phase is complete. For example, in Florida, the FCAT is administered once a year -- it is a summative assessment to determine each student's ability at pre-determined points in time.
The list is long, but here are some examples of summative assessments: 1  State assessments. 2  District benchmark or interim assessments. 3  End-of-unit or chapter tests. 4  End-of-term or semester exams. 5  Scores that are used for accountability for schools (AYP) and students (report card grades).
Informalassessment seeks to identify the strengths and needs of individual students without regard to grade or agenorms. INFORMAL ASSESSMENT TECHNIQUES Methods for informal assessment can be divided into two main types: unstructured (e.g., student worksamples, journals) and structured (e.g., checklists, observations).
Each time an error occurs, the judge circlesthe word or phrase. A description of the actual error can be taken from the tape after the session and analyzedfor errors in pronunciation, sentence structure, vocabulary, use of syntax, etc. (see Goodman 1973).
Curriculum-based assessment uses the material to be learned as the basis for assessing the degree to whichit has been learned (Tucker 1985, 199). This approach employs informal measures such as writing samples,reading samples from the basal series, and teacher-made spelling tests from the basal series.
Homework-Any written work students do alone, either in class or in the home, can be gathered and used toassess student progress. With teacher guidance, students can participate in diagnosing and remediating theirown errors. In addition, students' interests, abilities, and efforts can be monitored across time.
Summative Assessments are given periodically to determine at a particular point in time what students know and do not know. Many associate summative assessments only with standardized tests such as state assessments, but they are also used at and are an important part of district and classroom programs. Summative assessment at the district/classroom level is an accountability measure that is generally used as part of the grading process.
A. Formative vs. Summative Assessments. Classroom assessments can include a wide range of options -- from recording anecdotal notes while observing a student to administering standardized tests. The options can be roughly divided into two categories -- formative assessments and summative assessments. Formative a s sessments are on-going assessments, reviews, and observations in a classroom.

The lacrimal apparatus consists of the lacrimal glands, which secrete the tears, and the lacrimal sac and ducts, which convey the tears into the nasal cavity. Secretory function of the lacrimal glands declines with age, and many elderly individuals develop “dry eye” syndrome.
The nasolacrimal duct (sometimes called the tear duct) carries tears from the lacrimal sac into the nasal cavity. The opening of the nasolacrimal duct into the inferior nasal meatus is partially covered by a mucosal fold (valve of Hasner or plica lacrimalis). Excess tears flow through nasolacrimal duct which drains into the inferior nasal meatus.
Congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction is the most common abnormality of the entire lacrimal system in children. It presents with recurrent tearing and eye discharge in the early newborn period without conjunctival injection or photophobia.
The lacrimal sac or lachrymal sac[1] is the upper dilated end of the nasolacrimal duct, and is lodged in a deep groove formed by the lacrimal bone and frontal process of the maxilla. It connects the lacrimal canaliculi, which drain tears from the eye's surface, and the nasolacrimal duct, which conveys this fluid into the nasal cavity.
The lacrimal gland, which secretes tears, lies over the upper, outer corner of the eye; its excretory ducts branch downward toward the eyeball. A constant stream of tears washes down over the front of the eye and is drained off through two small openings located in the inner corner of the eye. Through these openings the tears pass into the lacrimal canaliculus, then through the lacrimal sac into the nasolacrimal duct and finally into the nasal cavity.
Excess tears are drained from the medial aspect of the conjunctival sac via the canaliculi into the lacrimal sac and nasolacrimal duct, to empty into the inferior meatus of the nasal cavity (Fig. 1-63).
a group of organs concerned with the production and drainage of tears; it is a nutritive and protective device that helps keep the eye moist and free of dust and other irritating particles. Includes lacrimal gland, accessory lacrimal glands, third eyelid glands and the nasolacrimal duct.
Inflammation of the lacrimal-glands is called dacryoadenitis. The lacrimal-gland produces tears which then flow into canals that connect to the lacrimal sac. From that sac, the tears drain through the lacrimal duct into the nose. The lacrimal bone is the smallest and most fragile bone of the face; roughly the size of the little fingernail. It is situated at the front part of the medial wall of the orbit.
The histologic features of nasolabial cysts show striking similarity to the physiologically encountered epithelia in the lacrimal drainage system, specifically the lacrimal canaliculi and sac and the nasolacrimal duct that drain tear fluid from the eye to the inferior meatus of the nose (Figure 1).
Uncomplicated mechanical stenosis may occasionally be relieved with simple probing, but severe cases (often following bacterial infection of the lacrimal sac) are treated surgically: a dacryocystorhinostomy is performed to anastomose the mucosa of the nasal cavity to the lacrimal sac through an osteotomy made in the lacrimal bone. 15

See also the articles in the Federal Reserve Bulletin for July 2002 (51 KB PDF) and November 1994 (75 KB PDF).
The Federal Reserve Banks offer three discount window programs to depository institutions: primary credit, secondary credit, and seasonal credit, each with its own interest rate. All discount window loans are fully secured.
The Discount Rate. The discount rate is the interest rate charged to commercial banks and other depository institutions on loans they receive from their regional Federal Reserve Bank's lending facility--the discount window.
The interest rate is fixed for the life of the loan. Loan terms can range from 12 to 60 months depending on the loan amount. The Great Rate Event special relationship discount is available on applications submitted 07/01/2016 through 09/30/2016.
Consolidate debt with a rate as low as. 5.99% APR, Annual percentage rate (APR) assumes excellent borrower credit history, ability to repay the loan, and a special relationship discount of 0.50% which requires a qualifying Wells Fargo consumer checking account and enrollment in automatic payments.
Mortgage points are essentially a form of prepaid interest you can choose to pay up front in exchange for a lower interest rate and monthly payments (a practice known as buying down your interest rate). In some cases, a lender will offer you the option to pay points along with your closing costs. In exchange for each point you pay at closing, your mortgage APR will be reduced and your monthly payments will shrink accordingly. Typically, you would buy points to lower your rate on a fixed-rate mortgage. Buying points for adjustable rate mortgages only provides a discount on the initial fixed period of the loan and isn't typically done.
annual discount rate of 6%. Total value. Calculate how much is your money worth in today's prices, i.e. the money's discounted present value, should you decide not to use this money now to purchase goods and services for certain number of years, taking into the account the money's annual inflation or discount rate.
If you have a Wells Fargo Time Account (CD) or Savings Account, you can use it as collateral for a personal loan to get a lower annual percentage rate (compared to an unsecured loan) without touching your savings.

Also, it is concluded that the maximum true stress values are almost 15% higher than that of the maximum engineering stress values while the maximum true strain failure values are 1.5% smaller than the maximum engineering strain failure values.
In some branches of engineering, the term stress is occasionally used in a looser sense as a synonym of internal force. For example, in the analysis of trusses, it may refer to the total traction or compression force acting on a beam, rather than the force divided by the area of its cross-section.
Built-in strain, inside the plastic protractor, developed by the stress of the shape of the protractor, is revealed by the effect of polarized light.
In general, the stress T that a particle P applies on another particle Q across a surface S can have any direction relative to S. The vector T may be regarded as the sum of two components: the normal stress (compression or tension) perpendicular to the surface, and the shear stress that is parallel to the surface.
Types of Deformation : Elasic Plastic Anelastic. Elastic deformation is defined as instantaneous recoverable deformation. Hooke's law : For tensile loading, σ = E ε. where σ is stress defined as the load per unit area : σ = P/Ao, N/m2, Pa. and strain is given by the change in length per unit length ε =.
The most commonly accepted method in evaluation of the mechanical properties of metals would be the tension test. Its main objective would be to determine the properties relevant to the elastic design of machines and structures. Investigation of the engineering and true Stress-strain relationships of three specimens in conformance with ASTM E 8 – 04 is the aim of this paper.
The specimens used in this test are made of low carbon steel with a thickness of 6mm, 8mm and 10mm respectively. First, the dimensions of the specimens (gauge length, thickness and width) are tabulated in Table 2 in order to determine the engineering stress and engineering strain values.
In continuum mechanics, stress is a physical quantity that expresses the internal forces that neighboring particles of a continuous material exert on each other, while strain is the measure of the deformation of the material.
The stress across a surface element (yellow disk) is the force that the material on one side (top ball) exerts on the material on the other side (bottom ball), divided by the area of the surface.
The ratio of the applied load to the instantaneous cross-sectional area is the definition of the true stress. There could exist a relationship between the true stress and engineering stress once no volume change is assumed in the specimen.
With the middle ear pressure of 30 being more than the ouside pressure of 10,, the eardrum bulges outward until the pressure inside and outside matches at 10. The bulging eardrum causes the ear to feel clogged. With ear popping, the eardrum moves back into neutral position and the ear feels back to normal.
I'm just getting over a cold, and my ears feel plugged. With plugged ears, your eustachian tubes — which run between the middle of your ears and the back of your nose — become obstructed. You may experience a feeling of fullness or pressure in your ears. You may also have ear pain, dizziness and muffled hearing. As swelling from the cold subsides, the obstruction usually resolves. If your ears are plugged, try swallowing, yawning or chewing sugar-free gum to open your eustachian tubes. If this doesn't work, take a deep breath and try to blow out of your nose gently while pinching your nostrils closed and keeping your mouth shut. If you hear a popping noise, you know you have succeeded.

Introduction (Click here to skip to nasal spray use). Before going into an explanation of why there are occasions when the ear doesn't feel right (ear fullness, clogged ears, fluid sensation) or makes unusual noises (ear crackling/popping), one must understand the anatomy of how the ear works when things are normal. If your ears hurt, click here.
Several factors cause plugged ears: wax buildup, air flow blockage to the Eustachian tubes, pressure differences in the middle ear, colds and sinus illness—all can cause your hearing to become muffled.
Unplug ears that are clogged due to a cold. Colds can often lead to sinus congestion, which in turn, block your eustachian tubes—which are connected to your middle ear and the back of your nose. When this gets stopped up, it can lead to a great deal of pain. Ad. 2. Do the Valsalva Maneuver.
The first picture reveals a pressure of 30 outside the ear (remember, the ear canal is open to the outside) whereas the pressure is only 10 inside the ear. This will cause the eardrum to bulge inward until the pressure outside and inside the ear matches at 30.

Stuffy, clogged ears: It is not uncommon for ears to feel stuffy and clogged when allergies flare up, when you experience a change in altitude or during the course of a cold. Sometimes this can happen as an ear infection evolves. This is from dysfunction of the eustachian tube.
HPV is a common sexually transmitted infection that affects up to 75% of men and women who are sexually active. Often those who contract HPV will not know because it did not present symptoms and resolved on its own. There are many strains of HPV, and some of them will result in the development of genital warts. These warts are very contagious and are easily spread from person to person via sexual activity. These warts will show up externally around the vagina, anus, in the rectum, or on the cervix.
A few of the more than 40 different strains of genital HPV may cause you to develop genital warts. (Some types of HPV cause the common warts you can get on your hands and feet, but genital HPV strains usually affect only the genital area.).
Treatment for Genital Warts While Pregnant. Treatment of genital warts while pregnant may vary from case to case. However, because the warts themselves do not usually cause any complications in pregnancy, your doctor may opt to not treat the warts at all during pregnancy.

The HPV DNA test can detect high risk types of HPV, such as types 16 and 18, before any abnormal cells can be detected on the cervix. This screening is recommended for women over the age of 30, who are at an increased risk of a chronic HPV infection turning into pre-cancerous cells.
You're most likely to get a genital HPV infection from vaginal or anal intercourse. It's possible but uncommon to transmit the virus through genital contact without penetration, through oral sex, or by touching the genitals. And a mother can transmit HPV to her baby during birth, but this is also uncommon.
Genital Warts During Pregnancy. If you have the strain of HPV that results in genital warts while pregnant, it is not likely to affect the health of your baby. Genital warts have been shown to grow faster during pregnancy due to discharge, as well as changes to in hormones and immune system. But genital warts during pregnancy are not generally considered to pose a serious risk to you or your baby.
Most people that are infected with HPV feel fine and do not even know they are infected. HPV can cause genital warts which may return after treatment. HPV may cause pre-cancerous cells on the cervix resulting in abnormal Pap smears. It may also lead to cancer of the cervix, labia, anus, or penis. There is no cure for HPV, which means that once you contract it, it can be a life-long infection.

DEFINITION of 'Underwriting Expenses'. Costs and expenditures associated with underwriting activity. Underwriting expenses include a wide range of expenditures, and the exact definition differs for insurers and investment banks. As a major expense category, the lower these expenditures are as a proportion of underwriting activity, the higher the profitability of the insurer or investment bank. Next Up.
underwriting expense ratio. The amount of a company's net premiums that were allocated to underwriting costs, like commissions to agents and brokers, state and municipal taxes, salaries, benefits and other operational expenses. This ratio is determined by dividing the underwriting expenses total by net premiums earned.
For an investment bank, underwriting expenses would include such costs as due diligence activities and research, legal and accounting fees. The expense ratio for an insurer is obtained by computing underwriting expenses as a percentage of premiums earned for a given period.

Underwriting expenses are the costs that an insurance company must pay to remain in operation. These costs are subtracted from the income of insurance companies to calculate net profit. Underwriting expenses can include a wide variety of costs. These expenses are also used by insurance companies to calculate the expense ratio, which is a ratio used to determine the percentage of premiums earned in a given period that must go to underwriting expwnses.
These advertisements are just one underwriting expense among many. After these underwriting expenses are paid, the insurance company can keep whatever is left over as profits. If the underwriting expenses are significantly lower than the generated income, then the insurance company can make substantial gains.

The total mortality of the 1918–1919 pandemic is not known, but it is estimated that up to 1% of the world's population was killed. As many as 25 million may have been killed in the first 25 weeks; in contrast, HIV/AIDS has killed 25 million in its first 25 years.
Pandemics can cause high levels of mortality, with the 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic estimated as being responsible for the deaths of approximately 50-100 million people. There have been about three influenza pandemics in each century for the last 300 years, the most recent one being the 2009 flu pandemic.
The 1918 flu pandemic, commonly referred to as the Spanish flu, was a category 5 influenza pandemic caused by an unusually severe and deadly Influenza A virus strain of subtype H1N1.
A Global Killer. The Spanish influenza epidemic, uniquely lethal in attacking young, healthy bodies, killed at least 20 million people worldwide, including an estimated 50,000 Canadians. The flu was spread through bodily fluids and moved quickly through the population.
One strain of virus that may produce a pandemic in the future is a highly pathogenic variation of the H5N1 subtype of influenza A virus. On 11 June 2009, a new strain of H1N1 influenza was declared to be a global pandemic (Stage 6) by the WHO after evidence of spreading in the southern hemisphere.
The global flu outbreak of 1918 killed 50 million people worldwide, ranking as one of the deadliest epidemics in history. For decades, scientists have debated where in the world the pandemic started, variously pinpointing its origins in France, China, the American Midwest, and beyond.
Flu Death Certificate This death certificate was issued to Sergeant Albert Giles, who died of influenza on 9 February 1919. Official medical records note that 776 Canadian enlisted personnel, of an estimated 50,000 Canadians, died from the flu.
The Spanish flu pandemic was truly global, spreading even to the Arctic and remote Pacific islands. The unusually severe disease killed between 2 and 20% of those infected, as opposed to the more usual flu epidemic mortality rate of 0.1%.
Canada’s flu dead included soldiers who had survived the fighting overseas only to succumb to illness once in Canada and thousands of family members who welcomed them home but perished soon after their arrival.
Origins Debated The Spanish flu reached its height in autumn 1918 but raged until 1920, initially gaining its nickname from wartime censorship rules that allowed for reporting on the disease's ravages in neutral Spain.
Bandwidth knowledge of results and motor learning: More than just a relative frequency effect. Abstract. Motor learning is facilitated when knowledge of results (KR) is presented in accordance with a goal-centred bandwidth (i.e. when the error exceeds a tolerance limit about a movement goal). However, under different conditions of the bandwidth procedure the frequency with which KR is provided is also affected—the wider the goal-centred tolerance limits, the lower the frequency of KR.

chemotroph. see autotroph autotroph, in biology, an organism capable of synthesizing its own organic substances from inorganic compounds. Autotrophs produce their own sugars, lipids, and amino acids using carbon dioxide as a source of carbon, and ammonia or nitrates as a source of nitrogen...... Click the link for more information. .
Overview of cycle between autotrophs and heterotrophs. Photosynthesis is the main means by which plants, algae and many bacteria produce organic compounds and oxygen from carbon dioxide and water (green arrow).
Most autotrophs use water as the reducing agent, but some can use other hydrogen compounds such as hydrogen sulfide. Phototrophs (green plants and algae), a type of autotroph, convert electromagnetic energy from sunlight into chemical energy in the form of reduced carbon.
An organism that obtains carbon from organic compounds but obtains energy from light is called a photoheterotroph, while an organism that obtains carbon from organic compounds but obtains energy from the oxidation of inorganic compounds is termed a chemoheterotroph, chemolithoheterotroph, or lithoheterotroph.
Chemotroph. Definition. noun, plural: chemotrophs. An organism (typically a bacterium or protozoan) that obtains energy through chemical process, which is by the oxidation of electron donating molecules from the environment, rather than by photosynthesis.
Phototrophs use light as an energy source, while chemotrophs utilize electron donors as a source of energy, whether from organic or inorganic sources; however in the case of autotrophs, these electron donors come from inorganic chemical sources. Such chemotrophs are lithotrophs.
chemotropism. growth or motion in response to a chemical stimulus. — chemotropic, adj. growth or motion in response to a chemical stimulus. — chemotropic, adj.
Diffen › Science › Biology. Autotrophs are organisms that can produce their own food from the substances available in their surroundings using light (photosynthesis) or chemical energy (chemosynthesis). Heterotrophs cannot synthesize their own food and rely on other organisms — both plants and animals — for nutrition.
Some organisms rely on organic compounds as a source of carbon, but are able to use light or inorganic compounds as a source of energy. Such organisms are not defined as autotrophic, but rather as heterotrophic.

In biology, a phylum (/ˈfaɪləm/ ; plural: phyla) is a taxonomic rank below kingdom and above class. Traditionally, in botany the term division was used instead of phylum, although from 1993 the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants accepted the designation phylum.The kingdom Animalia contains approximately 35 phyla, Plantae contains 12, and Fungi contains 7.raditionally, in botany the term division was used instead of phylum, although from 1993 the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants accepted the designation phylum.
Protists were traditionally subdivided into several groups based on similarities to the higher kingdoms: the unicellular animal-like protozoa, the plant-like protophyta (mostly unicellular algae), and the fungus-like slime molds and water molds.ome protists, sometimes called ambiregnal protists, have been considered to be both protozoa and algae or fungi (e.g., slime molds and flagellated algae), and names for these have been published under either or both of the ICN and the ICZN.
Algae use various combinations of the major chlorophyll pigments, chlorophyll a, b, and c, mixed with a wide array of other pigments that give some of them very distinctive colors. 2. Some protists are heterotrophs, a group of phyla called the protozoa.Heterotrophs get their energy by consuming other organisms. Protists reproduce asexually by binary fission, and a few species are capable of sexual reproduction.ntroduction to Kingdom Protista. The Kingdom Protista includes an incredible diversity of different types of organisms, including algae, protozoans, and slime molds. No one even knows how many species there are, though estimates range between 65,000 to 200,000.
Instead of Phyla, the Plant Kingdom is split into Divisions. Each Divsion group contains organisms that have things in common. Below is a list of some plant Divisions: Magnoliophyta Division: All flowering plants.These plants have leaves, stems, and roots.After flowering, they form fruits with seeds.nimal Kingdom.

Some protists are significant parasites of animals (e.g., five species of the parasitic genus Plasmodium cause malaria in humans and many others cause similar diseases in other vertebrates), plants (the oomycete Phytophthora infestans causes late blight in potatoes) or even of other protists.ome protists, sometimes called ambiregnal protists, have been considered to be both protozoa and algae or fungi (e.g., slime molds and flagellated algae), and names for these have been published under either or both of the ICN and the ICZN.
The definitions of zoological phyla have changed importantly from their origins in the six Linnaean classes and the four embranchements of Georges Cuvier. Haeckel introduced the term phylum, based on the Greek word phylon. In plant taxonomy, Eichler (1883) classified plants into five groups, named divisions.raditionally, in botany the term division was used instead of phylum, although from 1993 the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants accepted the designation phylum.
General characteristics of Kingdom Protista are as follows: 1  They are simple eukaryotic organisms. 2  Most of the organisms are unicellular, some are colonial and some are multicellular like algae. 3  Most of the protists live in water, some in moist soil or even the body of human and plants. Movement is often by flagella or cilia. 2  Protists are multicellular organisms, they are not a plant, animal or fungus. 3  Respiration-cellular respiration is primarily aerobic process, but some living in mud below ponds or in digestive tracts of animals ares strict facultative anaerobes.

The SPM Synchronous Motor Protection and Control relay controls starting, synchronizing, and protection of. collector-ring and brushless type synchronous motors. The SPM control functions for starting synchronous motors include accurate sensing of motor speed and rotor.
The Field Rheostat, while usually supplied sep­. arately with the motor or exciter, ordinarily is mount­. ed on the control panel. It is used to control the ex­. citer field which in turn affects the exciter voltage. and motor field.
DC field protection and control are provided by. the SPM. The field contactor and field discharge resistor completes the control assembly. 1.1.2 FUNCTIONAL OVERVIEW. The DC portion of the synchronous motor (rotor assembly) is protected and controlled using a drawout micro-. processor based multifunction relay.
Superior Electric is a Danaher Motion brand, and is recognized. worldwide as the leading manufacturer of synchronous motors. Over 40 years ago, Superior Electric developed and patented their. synchronous motors. The Superior Electric family of automation products includes: • Step Motors. • Step Motor Drives.
The most widely used types of cooling / protection in synchronous motors are: g IC01 - self-ventilated, degree of protection IP23. g IC611 - air-air heat exchanger, degree of protection IP54 to IP65W. g IC81W - air-water heat exchanger, degree of protection IP54 to IP65W.
The speed of a synchronous motor is directly proportional to the. applied frequency, as shown in the Speed vs. Frequency chart. However, because the winding impedance is also a function of. frequency it is necessary to adjust the voltage, to provide a constant. current and torque at different excitation frequencies.
The efficiency, the power factor correction, high torques and low starting currents, constant speed. under load variations, low operating and maintenance costs are the main reasons why synchronous. motors are chosen to drive different types of loads. Synchronous Motors. Projects.
An electric motor is an electrical machine that converts electrical energy into mechanical energy. The reverse of this is the conversion of mechanical energy into electrical energy and is done by an electric generator. In normal motoring mode, most electric motors operate through the interaction between an electric motor's magnetic field and winding currents to generate force within the motor.
SLIPSYN MOTOR CONTROL. INSTALLATION. Before installation, the customer should determine. whether the control I er is to operate (1) to resynchro­. nize the motor or (2) to trip the line switch on pull­. out. If resynchronizing after pull-out is desired, the. user must be sure that the motor has sufficient torque.
A DC motor is usually supplied through slip ring commutator as described above. AC motors' commutation can be either slip ring commutator or externally commutated type, can be fixed-speed or variable-speed control type, and can be synchronous or asynchronous type. Universal motors can run on either AC or DC.

Peridotite is the dominant rock of the Earth's mantle above a depth of about 400 km; below that depth, olivine is converted to the higher-pressure mineral wadsleyite. Oceanic plates consist of up to about 100 km of peridotite covered by a thin crust; the crust, commonly about 6 km thick, consists of basalt, gabbro, and minor sediments. The peridotite below the ocean crust, abyssal peridotite, is found on the walls of rifts in the deep sea floor.
Minerals, just like the mantle underneath it. Minerals are made up of crystalised molecules that have become cemented together - look closely at a chunk of granite for example, and you can see the individual crystals bound together. The difference is pressure, and temperature. Contrary to what many people believe, the mantle is not liquid magma.
Views · 3 Upvotes. Above the core is Earth's mantle, which is made up of rock containing silicon, iron, magnesium, aluminum, oxygen and other minerals. The rocky surface layer of Earth, called the crust, is made up of mostly oxygen, silicon, aluminum, iron, calcium, sodium, potassium and magnesium.
Feldspars are very common minerals in the crust, more than half (51%) of the crust is made up of this mineral group. Mica and clay minerals are also common, both comprise about 5% of the crust. Hence, aluminum is extremely widespread as well. It is usually not very concentrated in silicate minerals, though.
Peridotite is the dominant rock of the upper part of the Earth's mantle. The compositions of peridotite nodules found in certain basalts and diamond pipes (kimberlites) are of special interest, because they provide samples of the Earth's mantle brought up from depths ranging from about 30 km to 200 km or more.
Peridotite is a dense, coarse-grained igneous rock consisting mostly of the minerals olivine and pyroxene. Peridotite is ultramafic, as the rock contains less than 45% silica. It is high in magnesium, reflecting the high proportions of magnesium-rich olivine, with appreciable iron. Peridotite is derived from the Earth's mantle, either as solid blocks and fragments, or as crystals accumulated from magmas that formed in the mantle.

The crust is compositionally distinct outermost rocky layer of the Earth. What is the crust made of? The answer to this question depends on whether we want to know which chemical elements, minerals or rock types it is made of. It may be surprising... This page may be out of date.
The earth's crust is made up of rock that consists of primarily silicate minerals. Those are minerals like quartz, feldspar, pyroxene, amphibole, and mica. In addition to these major components, there are many lesser minerals, compounds, and elements... carbonates, oxides, sulfides, native metals, etc.
Gabbro is a mafic intrusive rock. The sample from Cyprus (from the Troodos ophiolite which represents former oceanic crust) is 7 cm in width. Basalt is a volcanic equivalent of gabbro. The sample from Northern Ireland is 8 cm in width. Andesite is a common volcanic rock which is intermediate in composition between mafic and felsic rocks.
More than 90% of the crust is composed of silicate minerals. Silicon and oxygen are the two most common chemical elements in the crust that also happen to like each others company very much. Pure silicon oxide is known as mineral quartz which makes up 12% of the crust.

Bullfrogs are the largest real frog found in North America, weighing up to 0.5 kg and measuring 460 mm in length. Their average length is 100-175 mm. Their color varies from brownish to shades of green, often with spots or blotches of a darker color around their backs.
A female bullfrog can lay as many as 20,000 eggs, which float in a clump on the surface of the water. Size relative to a tea cup: The baritone call of the bullfrog is so deep and resonant, it resembles the mooing of a cow, hence its name.
While cannibalistic traits are not completely uncommon in the animal kingdom, they are not overly common, either. It happens in relatively few species.

500 B.C. - Persian Script - Around the time of the first great Persian Empire of the Achaemenids around 500 BCE, Persian was written in a cuneiform syllabary. It was not a direct descendent of Sumerian and Akkadian systems, because even though Old Persian is cuneiform, its signs did not correspond to earlier signs.,600 B.C. - Giza Pyramids - There is no doubt that the Pyramids of Giza, the best known of all the Egyptian monuments, have a strong connection to the epoch 2,600 to 2,300 BC, the same dates as Stonehenge.

Why Lifting Heavy is the Key to Weight Loss. You know that losing fat involves increasing your metabolism. What you may not know is that muscle plays a huge role in raising metabolism. A pound of muscle burns about 10-20 calories a day while a pound of fat burns 5 calories. That means any growth in your muscle tissue is going to help you burn more calories all day long. Increases resting metabolic rate so you burn more calories, even while at rest.
When losing weight, you will lose some muscle mass along with body fat. If you don't perform resistance training regularly, up to 30% of the weight you lose can come from muscle tissue, which doesn't do your health, fitness or metabolism any favors in the long run.
3/13/2014 5:00 AM3/13/2014 5:00 AM : 16 comments : 760,754 Views. If you are concerned about how many calories you burn during strength training, chances are that you are actively trying to lose weight (or might want to ensure you are eating enough to support strength training without losing additional weight).
Typically, if you lift 60%-80% of max, you could do anywhere from 10-20 reps. Lifting at 80% and above takes you down to the lower rep range, which is where you'll be if you're trying to gain size. That means keeping your reps somewhere between 8-16, if you're lifting for weight loss and fitness. Your weights are determined by the number of reps you're doing. Choose a weight you can only lift 16 times. This is hit or miss, so you're experimenting.
The calories burned while weight lifting will depend on your gender, weight, height, age, and the intensity of weight lifting. For example, if you are female, weigh 150 pounds (68kg), are 5 feet 4 inches tall, and are age 45, you will burn about 3 calories per minute, or 174 calories per hour during light weight lifting. There are a few formulas you can use to calculate how many calories you would burn during any physical activity. One of the formulas is: Your basal metabolic rate (BMR) x Metabolic equivalent of task (MET) Basal Metabolic Rate or BMR is the amount of calories you burn while resting, every 24 hours.
Although strength training is challenging and requires a lot of hard work (especially when lifting heavy weights), it doesn't typically burn as many calories as cardiovascular (aerobic) exercises like running or cycling.
The problem is that most of us don't think much about how much weight we need, much less going through the process of figuring out 1 rep max for every exercise we're doing. In fact, I see many gym-goers lifting the same weights week after week, which is just one way to keep your body from changing.
MET for weight lifting is about 3 for light weight lifting, and about 6 for heavy weight lifting. So, the above example given will look like this: BMR: 655 + (4.35 x 150) + (4.7 x 64) – (4.7 x 45) = 1397 calories per 24 hours, 58 calories per hour. MET: 3.0.
You burn calories while doing work. Lifting weights is work. The longer you lift and to some extent, the more you lift, the more calories you will burn. You can see from this chart, that for most men, weight training will consume 300 - 500 Kcal/hour while running will consume 500 - 1300 Kcal/hr.
Gaining 30 pounds of muscle increases your RMR by 180 calories (average 6 calories per pound per day). While this might not seem large, at the end of the week that's 1260 calories which is the equivalent of two *hard* one hour workouts or a 1/3 pound of fat.

To the Editor: There are many differences between the United States and Finland. Finland has a population of about 5.5 million, while that of the United States is about 325 million. So the size of a bureaucracy to support a centralized health care system in the United States would be staggeringly large.

Best Answer: The mitochondria's MAJOR functions is to produce ATP (energy). The rest of the functions are as follows: signaling, cell differentiating, cell deaths ...
Mitochondria Structure Mitochondria are shaped perfectly to maximize their productivity. They are made of two membranes. The outer membrane covers the organelle and contains it like a skin. The inner membrane folds over many times and creates layered structures called cristae. The fluid contained in the mitochondria is called the matrix. The folding of the inner membrane increases the surface area inside the organelle. Since many of the chemical reactions happen on the inner membrane, the increased surface area creates more space for reactions to occur.
Best Answer: The mitochondria's MAJOR functions is to produce ATP (energy). The rest of the functions are as follows: signaling, cell differentiating, cell deaths and controles the cell cycle and cell growth. They play a role in the aging process. The organelle has particular compartements that carry out specific functions. The Major functions in a list: Regulation of the membrane potential Apoptosis-programmed cell death
Cell membrane - protects the cell. Mitochondrion - ATP synthesis (mitochondrion is the power house of the cell). Rough endoplasmic reticulum - protein synthesis. Smooth endoplasmic reticulum - lipid and saccharide synthesis. Lysosome - phagocytosis. Ribosomes - protein synthesis. These are the basics, organelles can have very many functions.
Structure and Function of Mitochondria. Mitochondria structure is quite compact and all of its functions happen within this structure. Structure of mitochondria. They are sac like double membranes structures present in the cytoplasm of cell. They can be seen only under an electron microscope.
Mitochondria Function: 1. It is well known fact that mitochondria are responsible for cell energy supply. 2. They produce energy in the form of ATP (adenosine triphosphate) by breakdown of carbohydrate substrates in presence of oxygen. This is how the food in body is converted to energy. Once we consume food, it is digested and absorbed into blood.
Sometimes a mitochondria can grow larger or combine with other mitochondria. It all depends on the needs of the cell. Mitochondria Structure Mitochondria are shaped perfectly to maximize their productivity. They are made of two membranes. The outer membrane covers the organelle and contains it like a skin
Mitochondria are known as the powerhouses of the cell. They are organelles that act like a digestive system which takes in nutrients, breaks them down, and creates energy rich molecules for the cell. The biochemical processes of the cell are known as cellular respiration.
Similarly those organelles with low physiological activity have less number of mitochondria. Further in a typical cell, their location varies within cytoplasm. But in general are more concentrated in the regions of the cell with high physiological activity. Structure and Function of Mitochondria in detail Mitochondria is one of the important cell organelles present inside a cell. Every cell has at-least one or more numbers depending on the requirement. The cells of those organs with high physiological activity posses more number of mitochondria.
Many of the reactions involved in cellular respiration happen in the mitochondria. Mitochondria are the working organelles that keep the cell full of energy. Mitochondria are small organelles floating free throughout the cell. Some cells have several thousand mitochondria while others have none. Muscle cells need a lot of energy so they have loads of mitochondria.
These tests are done: 1  To see if your kidneys are working normally. 2  To find out if your kidney disease is changing. 3  To see how well the kidneys work in people who take medicines that can cause kidney damage. 4  To check for severe dehydration.
1 White blood cells may be a sign of infection or kidney disease. 2  Casts. 3  Some types of kidney disease can cause plugs of material (called casts) to form in tiny tubes in the kidneys. 4  The casts then get flushed out in the urine. 5  Casts can be made of red or white blood cells, waxy or fatty substances, or protein.
Your body produces blood cells in the bone marrow. Since the overgrowth of plasma cells in the bone marrow can crowd out normal cells, leading to low blood counts, blood cells must be carefully monitored. White blood cells (WBCs) Normal range: 3.5-10.5 × 10 9 /L WBCs help fight infections.
If the test results show abnormal protein levels, then multiple myeloma, kidney, liver, blood, and other autoimmune diseases may be indicated. Calcium Normal range: 8.9-10.1 mg/dL All cells need calcium in order to work. The calcium blood test measures the level of calcium in the blood. If high levels of blood calcium are revealed, that may indicate kidney and bone damage. Creatinine, serum Normal range: 0.6-1.3 mg/dL Creatinine is a chemical waste product of creatine.
If there a an elevated WBC in the UA, it could be a sign of a UTI; however, it is not always the case. There are other markers in the UA such as leuk esterase which is an enzyme that bacteria uses for metabolism. If both WBC and leuk esterase are elevated, it more strongly suggests a UTI. There are people who have a UA with an elevated WBC without any symptoms. Patients without any symptoms, and no other indication of a UTI on UA could simply have chronic bacteriuria, which means the person chronically has bacteria in the urine.
Creatine is broken down into creatinine. Your kidneys take creatinine out of your blood and pass it out of your body in urine. If your kidneys are damaged and can't work as they should, the amount of creatinine in your urine goes down while its level in your blood goes up. Three types of tests can be done.
Urea is a waste product made when protein is broken down in your body. Urea is made in the liver and passed out of your body in the urine. The levels of blood creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) can be used to find the BUN-to-creatinine ratio.
This booklet explains common tests for patients with multiple myeloma. Your doctor uses them to help diagnose and assess your multiple myeloma, and monitor your progress and side effects.Reference ranges in this booklet are adapted from Mayo Clinic Laboratory Test Reference Values.
Your blood carries glucose to all of your body’s cells to use for energy. Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) Normal range: 7-20 mg/dL BUN is a measure of the level of urea in your blood. Urea nitrogen is what forms when protein breaks down.
Mine was 40 - 50. The best thing to do is to discuss these results with your primary care doctor. White blood cells (WBC) in urine is usually measured in something called a urine analysis (UA) The normal range is 0-5 wbc/hpf, like you mentioned. This test is usually ordered to determine is someone has a urinary tract infection.

Simple representation of a stack runtime with push and pop operations. In computer science, a stack is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements, with two principal operations: push, which adds an element to the collection, and pop, which removes the most recently added element that was not yet removed.
a more or less orderly pile or heap: a precariously balanced stack of books; a neat stack of papers. 2. a large, usually conical, circular, or rectangular pile of hay, straw, or the like. 3. Often, stacks. a set of shelves for books or other materials ranged compactly one above the other, as in a library.
An example is top of stack, or peek, which observes the top-most element without removing it from the stack. Since this can be done with a pop and a push with the same data, it is not essential. An underflow condition can occur in the stack top operation if the stack is empty, the same as pop.

Crystals for healing should be used as a compliment to other therapies and not as a replacement for regular medical care. With that said, for your condition, I would like to suggest a combination of crystals that can help to ease pain and address the fibroids and cysts. To send healing energy to the fibroids and cysts and to relieve pain, I would recommend a combination of Amethyst, Danburite and Smoky Quartz.

Fibroids are very common - they are benign (non cancerous) tumors of the uterine muscle. The size and location of the fibroid are important. The large majority of them are very small or located in an area of the uterus such that they will not have any impact on reproductive function.
Healing fibroids naturally can be done. If you have had fibroids for some time, you may have been led to believe that there is nothing which can be done to treat them other than invasive surgery. Indeed many doctors recommend taking no action at all as fibroids will naturally shrink at the time of the menopause.

Your rotator cuff is a group of four muscles and tendons that stabilize your shoulder joint and let you lift and rotate your arms. There are two kinds of rotator cuff tears. A partial tear is when the tendon that protects the top of your shoulder is frayed or damaged.
There are three types of rotator cuff surgery: 1  Arthroscopic: Your doctor will make a small cut in your shoulder then use an arthroscope -- a tube with a small camera and tiny instruments -- to fix the tear. This means your recovery time will likely be shorter than it would with another type of surgery.
Rotator Cuff Tears: Surgical Treatment Options. The following article provides in-depth information about surgical treatment for rotator cuff injuries, and is a continuation of the article Rotator Cuff Tears.. For a good introduction to the topic of rotator cuff injuries, please refer to .
Most rotator cuff disorders are treated without surgery. But surgery may be considered if the injury is very severe. Surgery also may be recommended if the shoulder does not respond well after 3 to 6 months of nonsurgical treatment (rest, ice or heat, use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and physical therapy).
The upper arm is attached to the shoulder by the rotator cuff, which is a group of muscles and tendons that form a cuff around the shoulder joint. The joint capsule is another nonbone part of the shoulder joint, and is made up of a sheet of thin fibers, allowing for a wide range of motion.
Your doctor may offer surgery as an option for a torn rotator cuff if your pain does not improve with nonsurgical methods. Continued pain is the main indication for surgery. If you are very active and use your arms for overhead work or sports, your doctor may also suggest surgery.
Surgery may be a good first choice for shoulder weakness caused by complete tears, especially when the rotator cuff is otherwise healthy (little or no degeneration). Surgery may be considered if you have severe pain and loss of shoulder function that has not responded to appropriate nonsurgical treatment.
There are three types of rotator cuff surgery: 1  Arthroscopic: Your doctor will make a small cut in your shoulder then use an arthroscope -- a tube with a small camera and tiny instruments -- to fix the tear. 2  Open: Your doctor uses larger instruments to go in to the muscles of your shoulder and fix the tear.
Surgery for rotator cuff disorders is done to: 1  Repair tendon tears and smooth the underside of the upper point of the shoulder blade (acromion) to make more room for the tendon and bursa. 2  Restore strength and use of the shoulder.
Surgical Repair Options. There are a few options for repairing rotator cuff tears. Advancements in surgical techniques for rotator cuff repair include less invasive procedures. While each of the methods available has its own advantages and disadvantages, all have the same goal: getting the tendon to heal.
Santa's elves were likely a bit warm this week during final Christmas preparations. Temperatures at the North Pole soared to the melting point of 32 degrees Thursday, according to data from a nearby weather buoy. That might not sound balmy, but it's some 40 to 50 degrees above average at what's typically an unimaginably cold, pitch-black point in mid-winter. 1  In fact, the average winter temperature at the North Pole is about 40 degrees below zero, the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution said.
Arctic 'heatwave' hits the North Pole: Storm Frank causes temperatures to soar by 60°F taking the icy region close to melting point. Temperatures were expected to creep above freezing yesterday; Unseasonable warmth is the result of weather system behind Storm Frank; Ocean measurements showed 28.6°F in the Arctic; By Ryan O'Hare for MailOnline
1/ The North and South Poles. The North Pole is a point in the Arctic Ocean around  700km (430 miles) north of the northern tip of Greenland, the closest land. The ocean is 4,261m (13,980 feet) deep at that point.
The Arctic has many large land animals including reindeer, musk ox, lemmings, arctic hares, arctic terns, snowy owls, squirrels, arctic fox and polar bears. As the Arctic is a part of the land masses of Europe, North America and Asia, these animals can migrate south in the winter and head back to the north again in the more productive summer months. There are a lot of these animals in total because the Arctic is so big.
comments. 1  The North Pole is experiencing a heatwave as temperatures came close to melting point yesterday, making the Arctic region warmer than some major cities in Europe and the US. According to ocean measurements from the North Pole Environmental Observatory, the mercury tipped -1.9°C (28.6°F) on Wednesday as the Arctic bathed in an unseasonably warm spell.
Which pole is colder? Really cold, or really, really cold? Both the Arctic (North Pole) and the Antarctic (South Pole) are cold because they don’t get any direct sunlight. The Sun is always low on the horizon, even in the middle of summer. In winter, the Sun is so far below the horizon that it doesn’t come up at all for months at a time. So the days are just like the nights—cold and dark.
North Pole v South Pole. 1  While the polar regions have many similarities, they are also polar opposites metaphorically as well as literally in many ways. 2  1/ The North and South Poles. 3  2/ Topography - the arrangement of the land and sea. 4  3/ Climate. 5  4/ Plants. 6  5/ Animals. 7  6/ Human inhabitants.
The North Pole is an insane 36 degrees warmer than normal as winter descends. Be the first to know about new stories from PowerPost. Sign up to follow, and we’ll e-mail you free updates as they’re published.

Metastasis, or metastatic disease, is the spread of a cancer or other disease from one organ or part to another not directly connected with it. The new occurrences of disease thus generated are referred to as metastases /mə ˈtaes ˈtæs tə/ (siːz sometimes abbreviated). metslthough advanced cancer may cause pain, it is often not the first symptom. Some patients, however, do not show any symptoms. When the organ gets a metastatic disease it begins to shrink until its lymph nodes burst, or undergo lysis.
In secondary or metastatic lymph node cancer, cancer cells from a malignant tumor of a distant organ travel to the lymph nodes via the lymphatic or blood vessels and lodge within the lymph nodes, where they continue to proliferate. Signs and symptoms of the primary cancer may be present but sometimes detection of an enlarged lymph node may be the first sign of cancer. 2  For example – an enlarged left supraclavicular lymph node is often the first sign of stomach cancer.
Metastasis is the spread of cancer cells to new areas of the body (often by way of the lymph system or bloodstream). A metastatic cancer, or metastatic tumor, is one which has spread from the primary site of origin (where it started) into different area(s) of the body.hen the cancer has spread to other parts of the body, it is called metastatic cancer. The liver, lungs, lymph nodes, and bones are common areas of spread or metastasis. Even when cancer spreads to a new location, it is still named after the area of the body where it started.
1 Metastatic squamous neck cancer with occult primary is a disease in which squamous cell cancer spreads to lymph nodes in the neck and it is not known where the cancer first formed in the body.igns and symptoms of metastatic squamous neck cancer with occult primary include a lump or pain in the neck or throat. Check with your doctor if you have a lump or pain in your neck or throat that doesn't go away. These and other signs and symptoms may be caused by metastatic squamous neck cancer with occult primary.

When squamous cell cancer spreads to lymph nodes in the neck or around the collarbone, it is called metastatic squamous neck cancer. The doctor will try to find the primary tumor (the cancer that first formed in the body), because treatment for metastatic cancer is the same as treatment for the primary tumor.igns and symptoms of metastatic squamous neck cancer with occult primary include a lump or pain in the neck or throat. Check with your doctor if you have a lump or pain in your neck or throat that doesn't go away. These and other signs and symptoms may be caused by metastatic squamous neck cancer with occult primary.
Cancer that has spread from the primary (original) site to other places in the body is generally classified as advanced. When the cancer has spread only to nearby tissues or lymph nodes, it is called locally advanced cancer. When the cancer has spread to other parts of the body, it is called metastatic cancer.The liver, lungs, lymph nodes, and bones are common areas of spread or metastasis.Even when cancer spreads to a new location, it is still named after the area of the body where it started. For example, a person with breast cancer that has spread to the bones is said to have breast cancer with bone metastases.hen the cancer has spread to other parts of the body, it is called metastatic cancer. The liver, lungs, lymph nodes, and bones are common areas of spread or metastasis. Even when cancer spreads to a new location, it is still named after the area of the body where it started.

This spread of cancer to a new part of the body is called metastasis. In order for cancer cells to spread to new parts of the body, they have to go through several changes. They first have to become able to break away from the original tumor and then attach to the outside wall of a lymph vessel or blood vessel.reatment of cancer is based on the type of cancer a person has, and the stage of the cancer. Doctors use a system to assign a stage to the cancer. The most common staging system is the TNM system. The T in TNM stands for tumor, the M stands for metastasis, and the N stands for lymph nodes.

When Australian scientist Ruben Meerman lost 30 pounds last year, one question kept bugging him: Where did the fat go? The answer might seem obvious: It was burned up, as we say — which implies that it was transformed into heat or energy.
The researchers chose to follow the path of these atoms when leaving the body. They found that when 10 kg of fat were oxidized, 8.4 kg were converted and excreted as carbon dioxide (CO2) via the lungs, and 1.6 kg became water (H20). In order for 10 kg of human fat to be oxidized, the researchers calculated that 29 kg of oxygen must be inhaled.
Exercise also increases the oxidation of fat, which then leaves your body via your lungs, in the form of carbon dioxide, and your bodily fluids, in the form of water. What’s not so complex however, is how to optimize your metabolism—even if you don’t understand the exact mechanisms involved.
The research conducted by a team at UNSW Science in Sydney calculated exactly what happens to our fat when we shed kilos, and revealed that doctor's leading theories are wrong - we don’t convert our missing mass into heat or energy, we breathe it out.
If you eat less than you exhale, you’ll lose weight. If you’re trying to shed pounds, don’t worry too much about all of this talk of carbon atoms and oxidation. Balancing the calories you eat with the calories you expend is a sound strategy. In fact, it’s what Meerman did when he trimmed down last year. “I was drinking three cappuccinos made with full cream milk each day, and I’d hit 40 years of age,” he says. “Your metabolism slows a bit as you get older so you can’t consume as many calories and expect to stay slim.
1 When you lose weight, you exhale 84 percent of the lost fat in the form of carbon dioxide. The remaining 16 percent is excreted as water via bodily fluids.  By substituting one hour of sedentary lounging with one hour of moderate exercise—to increase your respiratory rate—your metabolic rate is increased sevenfold.
Breathe deeply, Australian research shows that it’s going to take a lot of exhaling to get rid of that excess fat. FIONA MACDONALD. 17 DEC 2014. Despite society’s obsession with weight loss, a study has revealed that, surprisingly, most health professionals don’t actually know what happens to fat when we “lose it”.
Consider intermittent fasting: If you’re insulin/leptin resistant and/or are overweight, boost your body's fat-burning potential by incorporating intermittent fasting. This is one of the most powerful approaches to reverse insulin resistance. It is only necessary to do until your insulin resistance resolves.

To lose weight, you need to break down those triglycerides to access their carbon. The results showed that in order to completely breakdown 10kg of human fat, we need to inhale 29 kg of oxygen (and somewhere along the way, burn 94,000 calories). This reaction produces 28 kg of CO2 and 11 kg of water.

When you pull forward with your calves, the motion works all your thigh muscles. A similar machine exercises your hamstring muscles, on the back of your thighs. Lie stomach down on the bench and hook your heels under a bar. When you bend your legs and pull the bar upwards, you exercise the back of your legs.
Nutrition Dos. If you're underweight, your first step should be to consult with your doctor or dietitian about a healthy weight gain plan, but there are also some basic steps you should follow. Try eating more meals, not bigger ones, as big meals can make you feel too full and uncomfortable.
However, adding muscle through weight training can drastically improve your physique. Weight training won't make you look masculine, and when combined with a healthy diet, will actually make your legs look lean and defined, and enable you to put on weight in your legs in a healthy way.
Exercise to Gain Leg Weight. Although you can't make your body gain weight in your legs, you can perform exercises that encourage the growth of leg muscle. Squats, lunges and step-ups are examples of such moves that target the legs and recruit a lot of muscle fibers for growth.
Confidence votes 5.5K. You really don't gain weight in your legs but you can build the muscle in them by doing a lot of squats , calve raises, and leg presses on a weight sled.
Hold a dumbbell in each hand with your palms facing toward your body. Step forward with your arms at your sides, parallel to your body, and bend the knee of the forward leg, forcing it to bear the weight of your body. Return to your starting position and repeat with the other leg. Do this 8 to12 times with each leg. To build your calf muscles, lift a barbell and hold it against your thighs, or hold a dumbbell in each hand with your arms hanging straight down at your sides. Lift your heels off the floor 8 to 12 times. Increase the weight of the barbell or dumbbell as you get stronger.

Be careful with calories too: While you do need a higher calorie intake than normal, eating too many will lead to unwanted fat gain. Start by increasing your current intake by around 300 per day. If you're not gaining weight, then increase it, and if you're putting on fat, decrease it slightly.

When you do exercises intended to build muscle in your legs, lift weight that is between 75 and 85 percent of the maximum weight you could lift one time, called your one-rep maximum. The weight should feel extremely challenging by the last two to three repetitions in each set of six to 12 repetitions.
A. Vitamin B12 can be received in your diet through eating meats, eggs, milk and fish. The daily recommended daily requirement is set at 2.6 mcg. People that have a B12 deficiency may feel week, shaky, and experience mood disturbances. It is best to discuss your plan to take B12 as supplement with your doctor.
However, the vitamin A content of foods and dietary supplements is given on product labels in international units (IU), not mcg RAE. Converting between IU and mcg RAE is not easy. A varied diet with 900 mcg RAE of vitamin A, for example, provides between 3,000 and 36,000 IU of vitamin A depending on the foods consumed.
Daily Intake. The recommended daily allowance of vitamin E used to be 8 mg for women and 10 mg for men. However, these amounts were increased by the Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine in 2000. Currently, males and females over 14 years should consume 15 mg, or 22.5 IU, of vitamin E every day. If you take vitamin E supplements instead of consuming the vitamin in your diet, RDA increases to 33 IU. Breastfeeding mothers should get 19 mg, or 28.5 IU, daily, while infants and children need less, ranging from 4 to 7 mg respectively, or 6 to 9 IU.

Vitamin D is made in the skin and then travels through the blood to the liver and then the kidneys. In the liver and kidneys, vitamin D is converted to its active form, often known as 1,25 vitamin D, that then sets off the production of compounds needed to absorb calcium in the intestine.
Fatty fish like salmon, tuna and mackerel also contain vitamin D as do beef liver, cheese and eggs, although in much smaller amounts. When it comes to sun exposure, most people only need five to 30 minutes of exposure to the sun twice a week. This can be on the face, arms, back or legs. Beyond that amount, sunscreen should be used to avoid the harmful effects of too much UV exposure. Tanning beds shouldn’t be used to get more vitamin D.
MORE FROM THIS EPISODE. Unlike many of the essential vitamins, vitamin D can be made by our bodies. Unfortunately, cold winters and short days can make it tough to get enough sunlight for our skin to make this needed vitamin. Fortunately, there are a few fixes if you think you’re not getting enough.
The amount of vitamin A you need depends on your age and reproductive status. Recommended intakes for vitamin A for people aged 14 years and older range between 700 and 900 micrograms (mcg) of retinol activity equivalents (RAE) per day. Recommended intakes for women who are nursing range between 1,200 and 1,300 RAE.
There are different methods used to develop an amortization schedule. 1  These include: 2  Straight line (linear) 3  Declining balance. 4  Annuity. 5  Bullet (all at once) 6  Balloon (amortization payments and large end payment) 7  Increasing balance (negative amortization)
Outstanding Principal Balance The outstanding principal balance of a mortgage is simply the total amount of money it would take to pay off the loan in full. How much this amount is depends on how much was originally borrowed, how much has been paid down, and what the annual interest rate is.
Outstanding Principal Balance. The outstanding loan balance of a mortgage is simply the total amount of money it would take to pay off the loan in full. How much this amount is depends on how much was originally borrowed, how much has been paid down, and what the annual interest rate is.
Outstanding loan balance calculation. The outstanding loan balance at any given time during the term of a loan can be calculated by finding the present value of the remaining payments at the given interest rate. This amount will consist of principal only. Example of outstanding loan balance calculation:28000.00. Loan Term=*Interest Rate = 9%
An amortization schedule indicates the specific monetary amount put towards interest, as well as the specific amount put towards the principal balance, with each payment. Initially, a large portion of each payment is devoted to interest. As the loan matures, larger portions go towards paying down the principal.
An amortization schedule is a table detailing each periodic payment on an amortizing loan, as generated by an amortization calculator. Amortization refers to the process of paying off a debt over time through regular payments. A portion of each payment is for interest while the remaining amount is applied towards the principal balance. The percentage of interest versus principal in each payment is determined in an amortization schedule. The schedule differentiates the portion of payment that bel
For a fully amortizing loan, with a fixed (i.e., non-variable) interest rate, the payment remains the same throughout the term, regardless of principal balance owed. For example, the payment on the above scenario will remain $733.76 regardless of whether the outstanding (unpaid) principal balance is $100,000 or $50,000.

If you wanted to pay off your mortgage balance in full today, how would the outstanding loan balance be calculated? Your monthly mortgage statement will usually show the principal balance outstanding, but this is not the amount due to pay the balance in full. In fact, the statement probably even says that. If you want to pay off the loan in full, you have to call your lender and request an actual payoff amount.
Medically termed sinusitis, a sinus infection occurs when the cavities around your nose become swollen and inflamed. Sinusitis is most often caused by a virus and often lasts long after the other upper respiratory symptoms are gone. Rarely, fungus or bacteria may cause a sinus infection. Allergies, nasal polyps, a tooth infection, and a deviated septum are other ways in which sinusitis may be triggered.
Stuffy, Puffy, and Sore. Sinusitis causes many symptoms. Most people have a stuffy nose and pain or pressure in several locations around the face or teeth. There's usually a nasal discharge that may be yellow, green, or clear.
Some of the primary symptoms of acute sinusitis include: 1  Facial pain/pressure. 2  Nasal stuffiness. 3  Nasal discharge. 4  Loss of smell. 5  Cough /congestion.
Sinusitis can occur from one of these conditions: 1  Small hairs (cilia) in the sinuses fail to properly to move mucus out. 2  Colds and allergies may cause too much mucus to be made or block the opening of the sinuses. 3  A deviated nasal septum, nasal bone spur, or nasal polyps may block the opening of the sinuses.
The location of pain and tenderness may depend on which sinus is affected. Other common symptoms of sinusitis include: 1  Headache. 2  Yellow or greenish discharge from the nose or down the back of the throat. 3  Bad breath. 4  Stuffy nose. 5  Cough that produces mucus. 6  Fever. 7  Tooth pain. 8  Reduced sense of taste or smell.
Pain. The most common symptom of sinusitis, and often the most unpleasant, is pain. You have several different sinuses above and below your eyes, and behind your nose. Any of these can hurt when you have a sinus infection. Inflammation and swelling in the sinuses causes them to ache with a dull pressure.
Symptoms of sinusitis in children include: 1  Cold or respiratory illness that has been getting better and then begins to get worse. 2  High fever, along with a darkened nasal discharge, that lasts for at least 3 days. 3  Nasal discharge, with or without a cough, that has been present for more than 10 days and is not improving.
The symptoms of acute sinusitis in adults usually follow a cold that does not get better or gets worse after 5 - 7 days. Symptoms include: 1  Bad breath or loss of smell. 2  Cough, often worse at night. 3  Fatigue and general feeling of being ill. 4  Fever. 5  Headache -- pressure-like pain, pain behind the eyes, toothache, or tenderness of the face. 6  Nasal stuffiness and discharge.
Common symptoms of sinusitis include: 1  Postnasal drip. 2  Discolored nasal discharge (greenish in color). 3  Nasal stuffiness or congestion. 4  Tenderness of the face (particularly under the eyes or at the bridge of the nose). 5  Frontal headaches. 6  Pain in the teeth. 7  Coughing. 8  Fever. 9  Fatigue. 10  Bad breath.
Nasal and sinus passages become swollen, congested, and inflamed in an attempt to flush out offending inhaled particles that trigger allergies. Pollen are seasonal allergens. Molds, dust mites and pet dander can cause symptoms year-round. Asthma also has been linked to chronic sinus disease.

ABO incompatibility is a relatively common type of hemolytic disease of newborns, and may occur during blood transfusion reactions of older people. For purposes of this article, we will discuss ABO Incompatibility of the newborn.hile ABO Incompatibility is not generally as dangerous as other types of hemolytic diseases of the newborn, there are complications that can be caused by this disorder. Complications of ABO Incompatibility may include:
ABO Incompatibility is a fairly common and milder type of hemolytic disease of the newborn, and is caused by the result of an immune system reaction.hile ABO Incompatibility is not generally as dangerous as other types of hemolytic diseases of the newborn, there are complications that can be caused by this disorder. Complications of ABO Incompatibility may include:
Significant problems with ABO incompatibility occur mostly with babies whose mothers have O blood type and where the baby is either A or B blood type. Premature babies are much more likely to experience severe problems from ABO incompatibility, while healthy full term babies are generally only mildly effected.f your partner has two A genes then there is a 100% chance that the baby will be A. If your partner has an A gene and an O gene-then there is a 25% chance the baby will have an O blood group (and ABO incompatibility will not reoccur). The A blood type is dominant.
In contrast to Rh disease, about half of the cases of ABO HDN occur in a firstborn baby and ABO HDN does not become more severe after further pregnancies. The ABO blood group system is the best known surface antigen system, expressed on a wide variety of human cells.For Caucasian populations about one fifth of all pregnancies have ABO incompatibility between the fetus and the mother, but only a very small minority develop symptomatic ABO HDN.The latter typically only occurs in mothers of blood group O, because they can produce enough IgG antibodies to cause hemolysis.f IgG anti-A or IgG anti-B antibodies are found in the pregnant woman's blood, they are not reported with the test results, because they do not correlate well with ABO HDN. Diagnosis is usually made by investigation of a newborn baby who has developed jaundice during the first day of life.
Hemolytic disease of newborn due to ABO incompatibility Tikrit Medical Journal 2009; 15(2):70-78 73 the babies and this is consistent with the studies of john a. Ozolek, Jon F. Watchko and Francis Mimouni in 1993 (10), and supported by the fact found by Dean Edell (10) . French midwife was the first to report hemolytic disease of the newborn in a set of twins in 1609 (3) .HDN-ABO is a form of Isoimmune hemolytic disease of the newborn due to ABO blood group incompatibility between the mother and infant.
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. In ABO hemolytic disease of the newborn (also known as ABO HDN) maternal IgG antibodies with specificity for the ABO blood group system pass through the placenta to the fetal circulation where they can cause hemolysis of fetal red blood cells which can lead to fetal anemia and HDN.f IgG anti-A or IgG anti-B antibodies are found in the pregnant woman's blood, they are not reported with the test results, because they do not correlate well with ABO HDN. Diagnosis is usually made by investigation of a newborn baby who has developed jaundice during the first day of life.
If a baby is an O blood group-it will not be effected. If the baby is an A blood group-the baby may or may not be effected. Severe anaemia and dangerously high levels of bilirubin (jaundice) are the major concerns but are quite uncommon. ABO incompatibility does not causes sepsis.f your partner has two A genes then there is a 100% chance that the baby will be A. If your partner has an A gene and an O gene-then there is a 25% chance the baby will have an O blood group (and ABO incompatibility will not reoccur). The A blood type is dominant.
When this occurs, the mother’s blood cells develop antibodies that can attack the newborn’s blood cells and cause jaundice. The risk of this is highest near or during delivery. A-B-O incompatibility occurs when: 1  the mother is type O and the baby is B, A, or AB.2  the mother is type A and their baby is B or AB.3  the mother is type B and their baby is A or AB.he risk of this is highest near or during delivery. A-B-O incompatibility occurs when: 1  the mother is type O and the baby is B, A, or AB. 2  the mother is type A and their baby is B or AB. 3  the mother is type B and their baby is A or AB.

For babies effected by ABO incompatibility, anaemia may become an issue after a few weeks. The anaemia is caused by the faster than normal breakdown of the baby’s red blood cells caused by the mother’s antibodies.These antibodies can linger in the baby’s circulation for weeks after birth.f your partner has two A genes then there is a 100% chance that the baby will be A. If your partner has an A gene and an O gene-then there is a 25% chance the baby will have an O blood group (and ABO incompatibility will not reoccur). The A blood type is dominant.
The Autonomic Nervous System (ANS) is the involuntary division of the nervous system. It consists of autonomic neurons that conduct impulses from the central nervous system (brain and/or spinal cord) to glands, smooth muscle and cardiac muscle.
The Autonomic Nervous System at a Glance. The autonomic nervous system is the portion of the nervous system that regulates involuntary processes. In short, these are the processes that you do not purposely control. It's divided into two basic segments: the parasympathetic and the sympathetic nervous systems.
The brainstem regulates vital body functions such as cardiac and respiratory functions and acts as a vehicle for sensory information. Learning Objective. Key Points. In vertebrate anatomy, the brainstem (or brain stem) is the posterior part of the brain adjoining, and structurally continuous with, the spinal cord.
1 The brain stem also plays an important role in the regulation of cardiac and respiratory function, consciousness, and the sleep cycle.  The brainstem consists of the medulla oblongata, pons, and midbrain.
Autonomic Nervous System - Introduction. The organs of our body (viscera), such as the heart, intestines and stomach, are regulated by a branch of the nervous system known as the autonomic nervous system. The autonomic nervous system is part of the peripheral nervous system and controls the function of many muscles, glands and organs within the body. We are usually quite unaware of the functioning of our autonomic system because it functions in a reflexive and involuntary manner.
Video: Sympathetic Nervous System: Definition, Function & Effects. The autonomic nervous system is the portion that controls all of the involuntary functions of the body. This includes the body's response to emergency situations. In this article, we discuss the sympathetic nervous system and its responses under these circumstances.
The brainstem regulates vital body functions such as cardiac and respiratory functions and acts as a vehicle for sensory information. Describe the functions of the brainstem.

* increased blood pressure (increased contractility, increased ability of the heart to relax and fill) Parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) - the PNS is sometimes referred to as the rest and digest system. In general, the PNS acts in the opposite way to the SNS, reversing the effects of the fight-or-flight response.
Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. severe weakening and wasting of the involved muscle groups, usually beginning with the hands and progressing to the shoulders, upper arms, and legs. It is caused by decreased nerve innervation to the muscle groups.

A rather large stone used as a form of primative weaponary. 'Ducking' was primarily considered the best form of defence against such attack until, as a species, we became more intelligent and in fact 'running' is now considered much more effective.

In which case, usually the 'attacker' then becomes 'defendee.'. Thus, my opinion is that the name of this here weaponary be changed in fact to 'a Runner.' Although I admit, it does not have quite the same ring to it, nor would it prevoke the same sense of fear when used as verbal in attack.

Conjugated bilirubin. A water-soluble form of bilirubin formed in the liver by the chemical addition of sugar molecules to unconjugated bilirubin; when present in the blood, conjugated bilirubin can become chemically bound to albumin, forming delta-bilirubin (also known as biliprotein).onjugated bilirubin.

unconjugated bilirubin. bilirubin that has not been conjugated in the liver. It gives an indirect reaction to the van den bergh test. A high level of it in the blood is indicative of hemolysis or a lack of bilirubin clearance by the liver.Called also free bilirubin.ilirubin that has not been conjugated in the liver. It gives an indirect reaction to the van den bergh test. A high level of it in the blood is indicative of hemolysis or a lack of bilirubin clearance by the liver.

It gives an indirect reaction to the van den bergh test. A high level of it in the blood is indicative of hemolysis or a lack of bilirubin clearance by the liver.
Bilirubin that is bound to a certain protein is called unconjugated, or indirect, bilirubin. Conjugated, or direct, bilirubin travels freely through your bloodstream to your liver. Most of this bilirubin passes into the small intestine, but a very small amount passes into your kidneys and is excreted in your urine.ilirubin is a substance made when your body breaks down old red blood cells, a normal process. Bilirubin is also part of bile, which your liver makes to help digest the food you eat. A small amount of bilirubin in your blood is normal. Healthy adults produce 250 to 350 milligrams (mg) of bilirubin each day.
If bilirubin is not being attached to sugars (conjugated) in the liver and/or is not being adequately removed from the blood, it can mean that there is damage to your liver. Testing for bilirubin in the blood is therefore a good test of damage to your liver.ilirubin is a yellow pigment that is in everyone’s blood and stool. If you notice a yellowing of your skin or the whites of your eyes, this is called jaundice, and it may be caused by high levels of bilirubin. Bilirubin is made in the body when old red blood cells are broken down.
1 Small amounts may be present in the blood. 2  Conjugated bilirubin —formed in the liver when sugars are attached (conjugated) to bilirubin. 3  It enters the bile and passes from the liver to the small intestines and is eventually eliminated in the stool. 4  Normally, no conjugated bilirubin is present in the blood.wo forms of bilirubin can be measured or estimated by laboratory tests: 1  Unconjugated bilirubin —when heme is released from hemoglobin, it is converted to unconjugated bilirubin. 2  Conjugated bilirubin —formed in the liver when sugars are attached (conjugated) to bilirubin.

I assume it's something that trucks have, because I've never seen a car salesman offer me one, but aside from that I have no idea what a jake brake is or does. Since you are the master of all knowledge, I've decided to ask you to give me the Straight Dope on this device.
Unlike the wheel brakes you have on your car, the Jacobs Engine Brake (TM) is a compression release engine brake used by large diesel trucks, especially on steep downgrades. To understand how it works, remember that a diesel engine has much higher compression than a gasoline engine, typically 15:1.
The Jake Brake is a compression brake also know as a diesel engine retarder and Jacob F's answer above is absolutely correct. The reason I know this is that in the mid 1970's I was the manager of the department at Jacobs that assembled and tested the Jake Brakes. The Jake Brake is not an exhaust brake.
The jake brake slightly opens the exhaust valves when the piston is near top dead center (where ignition normally occurs). On the upstroke, the piston compresses the air in the cylinder to 1/15th its original volume. This creates a lot of drag on the engine.
A Jake Brake is an engine brake, also known as a compression brake, which is used to slow down a large vehicle. Diesel engines have greater compression than typical gasoline powered engines, and that compression is used by the Jake Brake to help slow the engine.
In short, the jake brake turns a power-producing engine into a power-absorbing air compressor, thus slowing the truck. The brake sits in a box over the engine. The trucker has a switch in the cab where she can choose how many cylinders to cut out; the more cylinders, the more powerful the slowing of the truck.
some of the answers are a little bit.. like.. Duh...! An exhaust brake (Jake Brake) is a way of slowing a diesel engined vehicle by closing off the exhaust from the engine, this causes the exhaust gas to be compressed in the exhaust manifold, and in the cylinder.
The company produces light-duty, medium-duty, and heavy-duty engine brakes, recreational vehicle exhaust brakes, aftermarket parts and tune-up kits to heavy-duty diesel engine manufacturers in the United States, Asia and Europe. The company was incorporated in 1990 and is based in Bloomfield, Connecticut.
A “Jake Brake” is an engine compression release brake used especially for steep hill downgrades. The Jake Brake opens the exhaust valves when the piston is near top dead center (where ignition normally occurs). On the upstroke, the piston compresses the air in the cylinder to 1/15th its original volume, which creates drag on the engine. The Jacobs Engine Brake then releases the compressed air and the energy stored in it before it can push back on the piston during the down stroke. The Jake Brake turns a power producing engine into a power absorbing air compressor and in turn, causes the truck to slow down.

As the plates move across the Earth's surface, they interact with one another at plate boundaries, which are places where earthquakes and volcanoes are common. Typically, plate boundaries are also places of great mineral wealth.
Convergent boundaries are boundaries where tectonic plates are moving together. Since the edges of both can't be in the same place, one plate will be forced under another plate (and the other above). The plate going 'down' will thus go deeper into the earth - allowing deeper earthquakes to occur.
Earthquakes are caused mostly by rupture of geological faults, but also by other events such as volcanic activity, landslides, mine blasts, and nuclear tests. An earthquake's point of initial rupture is called its focus or hypocenter. The epicenter is the point at ground level directly above the hypocenter.
Global plate tectonic movement. An earthquake (also known as a quake, tremor or temblor) is the shaking of the surface of the Earth, resulting from the sudden release of energy in the Earth's lithosphere that creates seismic waves.
Black dots mark the epicentres of all earthquakes recorded from 1964 to 1999. The most intense earthquake activity is where subduction is taking place, but there is some earthquake activity along the mid-ocean ridges and above mantle ‘hot-spots’.
Earthquakes are common at subduction zones, points where one plate moves below another. 1  Earthquakes are common at subductions zones, points where the Earth's plates meet and one plate moves below the other. The powerful earthquakes that are caused by this type of plate movement are known as megathrust earthquakes.
Most earthquakes occur on plate boundaries for a variety of reasons. When plates in the earth's crust move, they scrape or bump each other on the edges and boundaries. Therefo…re, the movements of the plates are more likely to be felt along the edges, where all of the activity takes place.
Earth's outer layer, the crust, is divided into a set of large moving plates. The lines where they meet are called plate boundaries. There are three main types of plate boundary: divergent, convergent and transform. Plates move away from one another at divergent boundaries.
Earthquakes at a Plate Boundary. An earthquake is a sudden motion or trembling in the crust caused by the abrupt release of accumulated stress along a fault, a break in the Earth’s crust. The ‘Ring of Fire’ shows the position of the New Zealand continent within a zone of intense seismic activity around the Pacific Ocean.
Most earthquakes occur at the boundaries of tectonic plates. And i think Most earthquakes occur along the edge of the oceanic and continental plates. The earth's crust (the ou…ter layer of the planet) is made up of several pieces, called plates.

Glial cells, sometimes called neuroglia or simply glia (Greek γλοία glue; pronounced in English as either /ˈɡliːə/ or /ˈɡlaɪə/), are non-neuronal cells that maintain homeostasis, form myelin, and provide support and protection for neurons in the central nervous system and peripheral nervous system.n general, neuroglial cells are smaller than neurons; there are about 86 billion neurons and 85 billion nonneuronal (glial) cells in the human male brain. Glial cells comprise about half the total volume of the brain and spinal cord.
A neuron (/ˈnjʊərɒn/ NYEWR-on or /ˈnʊərɒn/ NEWR-on; also known as a neurone or nerve cell) is an electrically excitable cell that processes and transmits information through electrical and chemical signals. These signals between neurons occur via synapses, specialized connections with other cells.Neurons can connect to each other to form neural networks. Neurons are the core components of the brain and spinal cord of the central nervous system (CNS), and of the ganglia of the peripheral nervous system (PNS).eurons can connect to each other to form neural networks. Neurons are the core components of the brain and spinal cord of the central nervous system (CNS), and of the ganglia of the peripheral nervous system (PNS).
by Naveen. Neurons vs Neuroglia. The nervous system is made up of two major types of cells known as neurons and neuroglia. However, many have an understanding that there are only neurons in the nervous system, and the supporting cells are forgotten. Neuron has an axon but, not in neuroglia. • Neuroglia form myelin but those are present and functional in the axon of neurons. • Neuroglia form packaging media between nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord and but not the neurons.
The central nervous system (CNS) consists of neurons and glial cells. Glial cells are astrocytes, oligodendroglia, ependymal cells, and microglia. With H&E stains, the CNS resembles mesenchymal tissues in which cells are set in an extracellular matrix.eurons come in all sizes. Motor neurons, which are the largest cells in the CNS, have a cell body measuring up to 135 microns. Granular neurons of the cerebellum, which are the smallest, measure 4 microns.
1 Neurons CAN generate action potentials...glial cells CANNOT. 2  However, glial cells do have a resting potential. 3  Neurons HAVE synapses that use neurotransmitters...glial cells do NOT have chemical synapses. 4  There are many MORE (10-50 times more) glial cells in the brain compared to the number of neurons.here are a few ways in which glia cells are different from neurons: 1  Neurons have TWO processes called axons and dendrites....glial cells have only ONE. 2  Neurons CAN generate action potentials...glial cells CANNOT. 3  However, glial cells do have a resting potential.

Neuroglia are also important for the protection of neurones in the brain, and there are almost the same number of neuroglia cells as the number of neuron cells in the human brain. The structure of this cell is like a spider or an octopus, but there is no axon as in neurons. Neuron has an axon but, not in neuroglia. • Neuroglia form myelin but those are present and functional in the axon of neurons. • Neuroglia form packaging media between nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord and but not the neurons.
• Neurons contain Nissl’s granules but not in Neuroglia. • Neuron has an axon but, not in neuroglia. • Neuroglia form myelin but those are present and functional in the axon of neurons. • Neuroglia form packaging media between nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord and but not the neurons.

Glial cells comprise about half the total volume of the brain and spinal cord.
Cell Body. In many ways, the cell body is similar to other types of cells. It has a nucleus with at least one nucleolus and contains many of the typical cytoplasmic organelles. It lacks centrioles, however.lial (Neuroglial) cells do not conduct nerve impulses, but, instead, support, nourish, and protect the neurons. Glial cells are far more numerous than neurons and, unlike neurons, are capable of mitosis.

Description. It is difficult to imagine the size of the blue whale, the largest animal inhabiting the earth. There are records of individuals over 100 feet (30.5 m) long, but 70-90 feet (23-27 m) is probably average. A good way to visualize their length is to remember that they are about as long as three school buses.

A visibly angry Geraldo Rivera threatened to knock out his Fox News colleague Eric Bolling on today’s episode of The Five. The two journalists, along with co-host Jesse Watters sitting in for Greg Gutfeld, got into a heated argument over illegal immigration and Donald Trump’s controversial comments about same.
You may not alter or remove any trademark, copyright or other notice from copies of the content. the-five. The Five, hosted by Bob Beckel, Eric Bolling, Kimberly Guilfoyle, Greg Gutfeld, Dana Perino, Juan Williams, and Andrea Tantaros, airs on Weekdays at 5PM ET on Fox News Channel.
Fox News' The Five cast member, Eric Bolling recently had the Chevy Volt for a week, courtesy of General Motors, who naively expected the celebrity to give a glowing report on their extended range, plug-in hybrid, or what I like to refer to as an electric hybrid.
When Rivera again accused Trump of exploiting the [illegal] immigration issue, Bolling — in an apparent allusion to Geraldo’s long flamboyant career on television — declared that “from a guy that exploits and sensationalizes everything, really?”. That’s when Rivera lost his temper.
So, here's the conundrum. If his drive is less than 20 miles from his home in New Jersey to downtown Manhattan and he acknowledges that the Volt gets only 25 miles on its battery, what happened to those remaining five miles? He flippantly refers to a two or three mile detour to pick up donuts. Okay, we're still short two miles. If he drives 18.8 miles to work and the car gets 25 miles in EV mode, he should have been able to drive the entire trip as an electric car. Instead, within two miles of his work place, the car reverts to hybrid mode, which the EPA rates at 37 mpg (city/highway combined).
The Celebrity Apprentice runner-up on Trump’s former NBC franchise has been appearing more often on the highly rated five-member panel show that airs weekdays at 5 p.m. Eastern since the Fox News Channel parted ways with Bob Beckel.
Earlier in the segment, Bolling got things rolling when he insisted that conservative pundits should stop bashing Donald Trump and instead focus on defeating the liberal/progressive agenda put forth by the Democrats.

What are Outriggers Used For? Mainly used in deep sea trolling, outriggers are a pair of long poles fitted on both sides of a boat that holds fishing lines away from the boat.It is usually made of fiberglass and aluminum, and is tilted at an angle between 70 to 80 degrees.enerally, outriggers improve the chances of a fish striking because not only does it allow the angler to cover more ocean space, it also permits the use of multiple lines.
When being used, outriggers are lowered to an angle nearly the same level as the water’s surface. At the edge of each outrigger is a pulley with a cord, attached to which is a quick release clip that holds the fishing line.enerally, outriggers improve the chances of a fish striking because not only does it allow the angler to cover more ocean space, it also permits the use of multiple lines.
In an outrigger canoe and in sailboats such as the proa, an outrigger is a thin, long, solid, hull used to stabilise an inherently unstable main hull.The outrigger is positioned rigidly and parallel to the main hull so that the main hull is less likely to capsize.If only one outrigger is used on a vessel, its weight reduces the tendency to capsize in one direction and its buoyancy reduces the tendency in the other direction.ooden outriggers appear on the new Trireme around the 7th or 6th centuries BC and later on Italian galleys around AD 1300 while Harry Clasper (1812–1870), a British professional rower, popularised the use of the modern metal version.

Outriggers also hold the fishing lines at a distance from both sides of the boat, spreading the lines far enough to prevent the risk of tangling. With more lines in the water, the angler can set them at different distances and depths that can create a variety of natural patterns to increase the chances of a strike.enerally, outriggers improve the chances of a fish striking because not only does it allow the angler to cover more ocean space, it also permits the use of multiple lines.
The outrigger float is called the ama in many Polynesian and Micronesian languages. The spars connecting the ama to the main hull (or the two hulls in a double-hull canoe) are called ʻiako in Hawaiian and kiato in Māori (with similar words in other Polynesian languages); in Micronesian languages, the term aka is used.n an outrigger canoe the paddlers sit in line, facing toward the bow of the canoe (i.e. forward, in the direction of travel, unlike rowing). The seats are numbered from 1 (closest to the bow) to the number of seats in the canoe, usually 6.
Outriggers telescope out away from a fishing boat to be able to drop fishing bait lines up to several feet away from the boat into the water. When a fish bites on the bait, the line rigged into the outrigger automatically transfers to a fishing pole that is properly secured into a gunnel on the boat.ooden outriggers appear on the new Trireme around the 7th or 6th centuries BC and later on Italian galleys around AD 1300 while Harry Clasper (1812–1870), a British professional rower, popularised the use of the modern metal version.

There are many different grades of steel that encompass varied properties. These properties can be physical, chemical and environmental. All steel is composed of iron and carbon. It is the amount of carbon, and the additional alloys that determine the properties of each grade.
Types of Steel can also be classified by a variety of different factors: Composition: Carbon range, Alloy, Stainless. The production method: Continuous cast, Electric furnace, Etc. Finishing method used: Cold Rolled, Hot Rolled, Cold Drawn (Cold Finished), Etc.

Different Types and Uses of Steel Beams. Not many are aware about the different types and uses of steel beams. Steel beams are extremely crucial and necessary for the construction any building or structure, such as bridges, etc. They come in a wide range of sizes and shapes.
Different types of steel buildings. Steel or metal framed buildings employ a construction design in which only the frame is made out of high grade steel. In addition to being light, easy to construct and inexpensive, these designs offer a lot more flexibility than structures made out of other materials.
Steel structure is composed of fundamental structural components. These fundamental structures can be joined preferably to erect an structure of desired shape, size and strength. The fundamental steel structures are: Beam. Column. Girder. Strut. Frame.
Quite often our customers will ask us about the different types of steel we sell, and what to look for when picking steel grades, shapes and sizes. While there are many ways to categorize steel, we find it useful to break steel down into four categories (Carbon, Alloy, Stainless and Tool Steel).
Different Steel Shapes. The majority of structural steel used in architectural structures are hot-rolled. They are produced in different grades which represent the yield-strength of steel. In the U.S., the “American Society for Testing and Materials” (ASTM) standardizes the different grades of steel.

Internally, stratified squamous epithelium has no need to be keratinized because it is not in contact with the outside world. So in areas such as the esophagus and the lining of the mouth, we find non-keratinized tissue.
The pharynx is connected to the oral and nasal oral cavities and contains the entrances to the Eustachian tube, and the larynx (described in detail in Chapter 4. Respiratory System, Larynx). The pharynx is lined by stratified squamous epithelium. The lamina propria of the pharynx contains minor salivary glands. The 4X micrograph presents the glands of the pharynx, the glandular soft palate forming the roof of the pharynx, and the epiglottis (the epiglottis is depicted in detail in Chapter 4. Respiratory System, Pharynx and Epiglottis 20X and 40X). The 10X micrograph shows those glandular elements in more detail, while the 20X micrograph displays the acini and duct of mucous glands present in the soft palate. The 40X micrograph shows the layers of the stratified squamous epithelium lining the pharynx. © 2004 Texas Histopages. All rights reserved.
Histology of the Pharynx. The pharynx is lined by both stratified squamous epithelium and ciliated pseudostratified epithelium with goblet cells. Different regions are lined by a different type of epithelium. Regions of the pharynx that are likely to be roughened up by food are lined by stratified squamous epithelium. Other regions of the pharynx are lined by ciliated pseudostratified epithelium with goblet cells. The vestibule is lined by stratified squamous epithelium.
Epithelium - Functions. 1  Epithelial tissues have as their primary functions... 2  to protect the tissues that lie beneath from radiation, desiccation, toxins, invasion by pathogens, and physical trauma. 3  the regulation and exchange of chemicals between the underlying tissues and a body cavity.
Because both food and air pass through the pharynx, a flap of connective tissue called the epiglottis closes over the glottis when food is swallowed to prevent aspiration. The oropharynx is lined by non-keratinised squamous stratified epithelium.
Single layer of columnar cells varying in heights that appears multilayered, all cells connect to basement membrane. Secretion & movement of mucin by ciliary action. Ciliated version lines most of the respiratory tract, nasal cavity, part of pharynx, trachea & bronchipharynx, trachea & bronchi.
Practice Questions. 1  influences motility and secretory activity of the GI tract. 2  protects the mucosa by secreting mucus. 3  produces zymogens such as pepsinogen essential for digestion. 4  secretes intrinsic factor necessary for absorption of vitamin B12. 5  transports H+ ions for the production of acidic gastric juices.

Cervical cancer screening is usually part of a woman's health checkup. There are two types of tests: the Pap test and the HPV test. For both, the doctor or nurse collects cells from the surface of the cervix. With the Pap test, the lab checks the sample for cancer cells or abnormal cells that could become cancer later.

Poppy Symbolism. The flower symbolism associated with poppies is beauty, magic, consolation, fertility and eternal life. The Egyptians included poppies at funerals and in burial tombs. The Greeks used poppies in the shrines of Demeter, goddess of fertility, and Diana, goddess of the hunt. Poppies denote sleep, rest and repose.

The dandelion actually has a Latin name of Taraxacum, which is not a nice name. But, the name actually comes from a French word and means “lion’s tooth”. While a lot of people look at this flower as a pest and a weed, to other people it has some meaning. The floral meaning of the dandelion is that it is a gift to a loved one that will provide happiness and is a promise of total faithfulness. SO, it can mean a lot to some people.
Gemstone Meanings: The Surprising Symbolism of Your Jewels. We’ve all heard that diamonds symbolize true love, but what are the symbolic meanings of other popular gemstones? From ancient times to today, gems of every hue have been imbued with significance and special powers by cultures around the world.
Poppies have been used for centuries in seasonings, medicine and health tonics. Tea from poppies has been used for its calming effect. The oriental poppy is the only poppy that contains opium, but other poppies do have mildly sedative effects, too. Water made from poppies is said to remove wrinkles and freshen the skin.
Poppy, unlike most floral names which are sweet and feminine, has a lot of spunk; Poppy makes an especially good choice for a redhead. Jamie Oliver -- the British Naked Chef -- used Poppy for his daughter Poppy Honey Rosie, as did Anthony Edwards, Jessica Capshaw, and Anna Paquin and Stephen Moyer.
Search by jewelry purpose. David Weitzman's jewelry are made to inspire and empower the wearer on the journey to happiness and fulfillment in life. Behind each jewel, there is a meaning like love, abundance, courage, healing and self-balance. The meaning of the jewelry is composed of shapes that resonate in harmony, carefully chosen words and David's strong intention.
One notable Poppy is Australian Without a Trace star Poppy Montgomery (full name Poppy Petal Emma Elizabeth--her mother named all her daughters after flowers: Lily, Daisy, Marigold and Rosie). Although she's never made the list in the US, Poppy is on a popularity roll in England, Scotland, and Wales.
Uses for the Dandelion Flower. So, of course, for some people, with the floral meaning of the dandelion, they give it out to show their faithfulness to their partner. This is one thing that people do with a dandelion. But, there are a lot of other uses for a dandelion too.
Famous People Named Poppy. Poppy Z. Brite (born Melissa Ann Brite, now Billy Martin), American novelist. Poppy Petal Emma Elizabeth Deveraux Montgomery, Australian actress. Poppy Angela Delevingne, English model and socialite; sister of model Cara Delevingne.
Radio Frequency Wireless Technology in Medical Devices - Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff. This guidance represents the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) current thinking on this topic.
In addition, the device performance and specifications related to the wirelessly enabled medical device functions should be considered in choosing the appropriate RF wireless technology (e.g., WMTS, IEEE 802.11) and RF frequency of operation.
I'm looking for suggestions for a wireless transmitter & receiver combination. I'm basically just trying to bridge several buttons over a wireless signal(s) (i.e. send a 1 bit signal) in as small a package as possible: Very short range (needs to be 99% reliable at ~3 ft away, no line-of-sight).
RF module. RF Module with ruler for size reference. An RF module (radio frequency module) is a (usually) small electronic device used to transmit and/or receive radio signals between two devices. In an embedded system it is often desirable to communicate with another device wirelessly.
There are essentially two parameters to look at when trying to determine range. 1  Transmit Power. Transmit power refers to the amount of RF power that comes out of the antenna port of the radio. 2  Receiver sensitivity. Receiver sensitivity refers to the minimum level signal the radio can demodulate.
Low power, especially for the transmitter. I'd like to be able to send ~10,000 pulses off of a watch battery. Very small transmitter (needs to fit inside something around 1 in^3, though I have a fair bit of flexibility on placement) Would like to prevent accidental cross-talk.
All of the Wi-Fi variants (802.11b, g and n products) use the same 2.4 GHz radio frequency, and as a result are designed to be compatible with each other, so you can usually use devices based on the different standards within the same wireless network.
Just as a wireless network's speed can vary greatly, so too can the range. For example, 802.11b and g officially work over a distance of up to 328 feet indoors or 1,312 feet outdoors, but the key term there is up to. Chances are you won't see anywhere close to those numbers.
RF Basics. Radio Frequency (RF) communications is based on laws of physics that describe the behavior of electromagnetic energy waves. For the purpose of providing a very cursory understanding of the technology this tutorial will use very informal terminology to describe what is happening.
See Appendix A for a glossary of key terms associated with RF wireless technology and wireless medical devices that have been adapted from the IEC 60050-161 International Electrotechnical Vocabulary (IEV) and other sources.

Mastoiditis may occur as a complication of acute or chronic otitis media. Acute otitis media (AOM), an acute illness marked by the presence of middle ear fluid and inflammation of the mucosa that lines the middle ear space, is discussed separately. (See Acute otitis media in adults (suppurative and serous).)
Mastoiditis (Definition) Mastoiditis is an infection of the mastoid bone, which is a bone of the skull, located just behind the ear. The mastoid bone has air-containing spaces in which an infection can develop. Patients usually have pain and redness in the area of the skull behind the ear. ...Read more.
Symptoms of mastoiditis include: 1  Ear pain. 2  Fluid discharge from the ear. 3  Redness of the ear or behind the ear.  Swelling behind the ear that may cause the ear to stick 1  out. Fever. 2  Headaches. Hearing 3  loss. In the disease's late stages, abscesses in the neck called Bezold's abscesses.
Mastoiditis is usually caused by a middle ear infection (acute otitis media). The infection may spread from the ear to the mastoid bone of the skull. The mastoid bone fills with infected materials and its honeycomb-like structure may deteriorate. Mastoiditis usually affects children. Before antibiotics, mastoiditis was one of the leading causes of death in children.
Chronic Mastoiditis. It is an infection of the mastoid bone and the middle ear. The condition is also known as Chronic Suppurative Mastoiditis. The disorder gives rise to very discomforting symptoms like persistent drainage from the eardrum. It is an acute infection that can damage the middle ear structures and the mastoid bone.
Chronic otitis media is a recurrent infection of the middle ear and/or mastoid air cell tract in the presence of a tympanic membrane perforation. Symptoms commonly associated with chronic ear disease include hearing loss, otorrhea, aural fullness, otalgia, and occasionally true vertigo. Cholesteatoma, a keratinized mass in the middle ear or mastoid, may occur either as a primary lesion or secondary to tympanic membrane perforation.
Acute mastoiditis with osteitis. This is a surgically treated disease, although coverage with appropriate antibiotics is mandatory. Mastoidectomy with insertion of a tympanostomy tube is required to remove areas of coalescence within the temporal bone.
It is most prevalent in children. Before the invention of antibiotics, mastoiditis was actually one of the leading causes of death amongst children. Symptoms of mastoiditis include: Ear pain. Fluid discharge from the ear. Redness of the ear or behind the ear. Swelling behind the ear that may cause the ear to stick out.
Creation of the initial groove and the vertical line. The mastoid cortex is now removed over the Macewen triangle (which is a rough guide to the position of the underlying mastoid antrum) using a drill fitted with a large cutting burr (5-6 mm). In adults, the antrum is encountered at a depth of 15-17 mm.

The primary targets of the stiff-legged dumbbell deadlift are your hamstrings. The hamstrings comprise a group of muscles that run along the back of your thigh. The muscles that make up the hamstrings are the biceps femoris, semitendinosus and semimembranosus.
Using a barbell instead of dumbbells for the stiff-leg deadlift exercise locks your wrists and forearms into one grip position. Because each arm can move independently with dumbbells, your wrist, forearm and shoulder complex rotates at a natural angle during the movement, making for a more comfortable grip.
Core strength (core pertaining to the central muscles of the body; lower back, glutes and the abdominal region) is a very important health component, in that it supports the body in almost every movement and position, and the deadlift is the key core strength building movement.
The stiff-leg deadlift targets the hamstrings and buttocks muscles. Although often done with a barbell, using dumbbells for the stiff-leg deadlift exercise offers some advantages. When first learning the stiff-leg deadlift exercise, start with light dumbbells while you perfect the technique.

It could be argued that, in a powerlifting context, the deadlift is a true measure of strength due to its lack of emphasis on various performance aids (suits etc). It also employs more muscle groups, and therefore could be deemed a better test of overall muscle strength.
If you want to strengthen your back muscles -- whether to help you perform more pullups or to improve your rowing efforts -- the stiff-legged dumbbell deadlift is a good choice. This exercise targets numerous back muscles, including your erector spinae, rhomboids, trapezius, latissimus dorsi and levator scapulae.
The deadlift will also strengthen all the surrounding supporting muscles of the waist, backside, hips and, of course, lower back. Core strength is important in terms of maintaining ones balance, and weight transference (whether in sport or daily life).
With dumbbells, you can perform a one-leg, stiff-leg deadlift. Position the working leg one or two steps in front of the non-working leg. Hold the dumbbells in front of the working leg and perform the exercise in the same manner as the two-leg version.

It's normal for athletic kids to have slower resting heart rates, often in the 40s or 50s.
Age & activity relat: There is a range of accepted normal heart rate for infants that varies with sleep/wake/activities & deciding when they are transitioning from one state to the next is sometimes hard. 0-3m awake 85-205, asleep 80-160; 3m-2yr awake 100-190 & asleep 60-140. ...Read more.
Your baby’s steady heart rate will range from around 120-180 beats per minute when in the womb, to around only 60 beats per minute by the time they are an adult. When your baby is sleeping deeply his or her heart rate will naturally be quite a bit lower than when he/she is sleeping lightly or is fully awake.
At about 5 weeks gestation, your baby's heart begins to beat. 1  At this point, a normal fetal heart rate is about the same heart rate as the mother's: about 80-85 beats per minute (BPM). From this point, it will increase its rate about 3 beats per minute per day during that first month.
What do heart rate and oxygen levels mean? At first, it might feel a little overwhelming to see your baby’s heart rate and oxygen levels but this data is meant to empower you, not confuse you.

If your child's heart rate is within the normal range, you don't need to call the doctor (unless your doctor asked you to call with the reading, in which case you should call to report that it's normal). There's also no need to call if the heart rate slowed down or sped up while you were taking the pulse.
When to Take a Child's Pulse. Usually, there's no need to take your child's pulse. Your doctor will check your child's heart rate at well checkups. But if your child has a medical condition that requires you to monitor his or her heart rate, your doctor may have told you when to take a pulse.
At about 5 weeks gestation, your baby's heart begins to beat. 1  At this point, a normal fetal heart rate is about the same heart rate as the mother's: about 80-85 beats per minute (BPM). 2  At this point, it begins a rapid deceleration to the normal fetal heart rate for the middle of the pregnancy to about 120-180 BPM.
His heart rate is 30 beats per minute. You administer positive pressure ventilation with 100% FiO2 and note good chest wall rise with each positive pressure breath. The infant continues to be apneic and bradycardic with a heart rate of 40 bpm. Chest compressions are begun and positive pressure ventilation is continued. Following 30 seconds of coordinated ventilation and chest compressions, his heart rate is still 40 bpm.
It has been linked to asthma, skin conditions, hormone disruption, and in long-term animal studies to cancer and damage to DNA. -PGPR is short for polyglycerol polyricinoleate, a goopy yellowish liquid made from castor beans that reduces the viscosity of chocolate. Since 2006, big chocolate manufacturers such as Hershey’s have been replacing the expensive raw ingredient cocoa butter with PGPR in their recipes. PGPR is produced by Danisco, a Dupont company.
Using PGPR enables the chocolate company to actually cut down on the amount of cacao butter they add to their product which is much more expensive than sugar. But the problem comes in when you attempt to make the chocolate sugar-free since sugar alternatives are quite a bit more expensive than sugar is.
Castor oil is a vegetable oil obtained by pressing the seeds of the castor oil plant. The common name castor oil, from which the plant gets its name, probably comes from its use as a replacement for castoreum, a perfume base made from the dried perineal glands of the beaver.

By using Palsgaard4150 (PGPR) the chocolate recipe has lower costs in terms of less cocoa butter.” In other words, PGPR is a way for chocolate manufacturers to get around the hassle and expense of actually putting chocolate in their chocolate.
The castor oil plant, Ricinus communis, is a species of flowering plant in the spurge family, Euphorbiaceae. It belongs to a monotypic genus, Ricinus, and subtribe, Ricininae. The evolution of castor and its relation to other species is currently being studied. [1] Its seed is the castor bean which, despite its name, is not a true bean. Castor is indigenous to the southeastern Mediterranean Basin, Eastern Africa, and India, but is widespread throughout tropical regions (and widely grown elsewhere as an ornamental plant). [2] Castor seed is the source of castor oil, which has a wide variety of uses.
Polyglycerol polyricinoleate (PGPR), E476, is an emulsifier made from glycerol and fatty acids (usually from castor bean, but also from soybean oil). In chocolate, compound chocolate and similar coatings, PGPR is mainly used with another substance like lecithin [2] to reduce viscosity.
It is made up of a short chain of glycerol molecules connected by ether bonds, with ricinoleic acid side chains connected by ester bonds. PGPR is a yellowish, viscous liquid, and is strongly lipophilic: it is soluble in fats and oils and insoluble in water and ethanol.
PGPR is often hailed as a cost-saving move for chocolate companies because it is much cheaper than cocoa butter, but it is rarely pointed out that for those companies who manufacture the chocolate themselves, there is money to be made in redirecting part of their foodstuffs to rub on consumers' skins at a much higher price than that of chocolate.
I looked and there it was, PGPR in my Chocolate Bar! What in the world is PGPR? I found my self stumped because I had never seen this ingredient before in my life and I am an avid label reader. I rushed up the stairs to my office and googled it...

1 There are tests people can take on their own and others that must be administered by a tra…. 2  Understanding IQ Scores and Genius Status The intelligence quotient (IQ) was developed to identify children who would have difficulty keeping up in the public school system.
On the Wechsler,  that would be a score of 132. The term genius is subjective and  individuals who are said to have IQs above the ceiling of  conventional IQ tests have to be studied on an individual basis by  experts.
High IQ Rating Scale. When you score considerably high score there are chances that you may fall in the category of genius people. An IQ scoring of 140 to 145 definitely qualifies you for this category. The psychologists believe that 1 out of 400 people can score this level.
High IQ & Genius IQ. Genius IQ is generally considered to begin around 140 to 145, representing ~.25% of the population (1 in 400). Here's a rough guide: 1  115-124 - Above average (e.g., university students). 2  125-134 - Gifted (e.g., post-graduate students). 3  135-144 - Highly gifted (e.g., intellectuals).
-------------------------------------------------------    An IQ score of 140 is considered Genius, so 160 is definitely in  the genius range. 140 is the lowest score in the Genius IQ range.  The highest IQ measured under the current testing is 210.
IQ Ratings of Over 140 --Genius or near genius IQ Ratings of 120 to 140--Highly intelligent IQ Ratings of 110 to 119 --Very intelligent IQ Rating of 90 to 109 --Normal or average intelligence IQ Ratings of 80 to 89 -- Dullness IQ Rating of 70-79 --Borderline deficiency IQ Ratings below 70 --Definite feeble-mindedness.
50% of IQ scores fall between 90 and 110 70% of IQ scores fall between 85 and 115 95% of IQ scores fall between 70 and 130 99.5% of IQ scores fall between 60 and 140 5% of people have an IQ below 70.
Using scores from the highly respected WAIS-III IQ test, an IQ of 135 would be seen in 1 of every 100 people; an IQ of 145 in 1 of 1000 people; while an IQ of 155 (the WAIS test ceiling) would be seen in only 1 in every 10,000 people.
Actually you can think of it this way, 100 is the IQ of an Average person. So for a genius, I would say that an IQ of 140 would qualify. The person with the highest IQ was actually Marilyn vos Savant who has an IQ of 228.
It is said that Einstein had the IQ of 160 and that is not the most gifted or Immeasurable genius. The higher IQ rating is a natural and innate ability that can be improved. But it can not be claimed to be a definite measure of success. In other words a higher IQ rating can’t guarantee a success in your life.

An energy pyramid is a presentation of the trophic levels in an ecosystem. Energy from the sun is transferred through the ecosystem by passing through various trophic levels. Roughly 10% of the energy is transferred from one trophic level to the next, thus preventing a large amounts of trophic levels.hen an ecosystem is healthy, this graph produces a standard ecological pyramid. This is because in order for the ecosystem to sustain itself, there must be more energy at lower trophic levels than there is at higher trophic levels.
An ecological pyramid (also trophic pyramid, energy pyramid, or sometimes food pyramid) is a graphical representation designed to show the biomass or bio productivity at each trophic level in a given ecosystem. Biomass is the amount of living or organic matter present in an organism.hen an ecosystem is healthy, this graph produces a standard ecological pyramid. This is because in order for the ecosystem to sustain itself, there must be more energy at lower trophic levels than there is at higher trophic levels.
The food and energy pyramid shows the complex interdependence between plant and animal organisms in the ecosystem.The pyramid has several levels.

This is where an energy pyramid (sometimes called a trophic pyramid or ecological pyramid) is useful in quantifying the energy transfer from one organism to another along the food chain. Energy decreases as you move through the trophic levels from the bottom to the top of the pyramid.or Teachers for Schools for Companies. When organisms eat other organisms, energy is transferred. An energy pyramid can be used to diagram this flow of metabolic energy. Here we will examine the definition of an energy pyramid, look at some examples, and finish with a brief quiz.

The biotic components of an ecosystem are classified into three levels: producers, consumers, and decomposers. An energy pyramid is a model that shows the flow of energy from one trophic, or feeding, level to the next in an ecosystem.The model is a diagram that compares the energy used by organisms at each trophic level.The energy in an energy pyramid is measured in units of kilocalories (kcal).nergy pyramids such as this help to explain the trophic structure of an ecosystem: the number of consumer trophic levels that can be supported is dependent on the size and energy richness of the producer level.
A biomass pyramid shows the total mass of the organisms that each trophic level occupies in an ecosystem. Usually, producers have a higher biomass than any other trophic level, but there can be lower amounts of biomass at the bottom of the pyramid if the rate of primary production per unit biomass is very fast.hen an ecosystem is healthy, this graph produces a standard ecological pyramid. This is because in order for the ecosystem to sustain itself, there must be more energy at lower trophic levels than there is at higher trophic levels.
The largest source of energy for an ecosystem is the sun. Energy that is not used in an ecosystem is eventually lost as heat. Energy and nutrients are passed around through the food chain, when one organism eats another organism.Any energy remaining in a dead organism is consumed by decomposers.n Ecological Pyramid of Biomass shows the relationship between energy and trophic level by quantifying the amount of biomass present at each trophic level (dry mass per trophic level). As such, is assumed that there is a direct relationship between biomass and energy.

How to Know Your Options of What to do for Fighting to Get Out of a First Offense DUI case. When a person has been arrested for first-time DUI offense charges, it can often feel like there are no options or little help for learning what to do when fighting to get out of a 1st offense DUI case.
For fighting to get out of a first-time DUI offense arrest charge, if you have no prior criminal record or previous alcohol or DUI/DWI related offenses, it is possible that the judge will suspend your jail sentence and place you on probation for a period typically ranging from 6 months to 2 years.
1 Having to get high risk auto insurance after a conviction of a 1st DUI offense, can cost up to $8,000 or more annually for the next 5 years.  Since any DUI and DWI offense conviction is on a person’s criminal record for life, it can deny entry into many other countries when traveling in the future.
Although there doesn't appear to be any indication that the fight was mutual, people might be wondering about the legality of bar fights in the first place. After all, whether its TV or movies, for some reason you never see the police show up to, much less someone get arrested for, a bar fight. The poor bartender just ends up holding his hands on his head and gazing in dismay at a scene of shattered tables, barstools and mirrors as the combatants stumble on out. Well, just in case there is any doubt remaining, yes, you can very easily get arrested for a bar fight. Bars are not anything-goes-zones and the criminal laws that apply on the street and everywhere else still apply inside, despite the possibility that a host of beers may have changed everyone's opinion on the subject.
The lithosphere, which is the rigid outermost shell of a planet (the crust and upper mantle), is broken up into tectonic plates. The Earth's lithosphere is composed of seven or eight major plates (depending on how they are defined) and many minor plates.
Divergent boundaries are where the plates move away from each other and new crust is created. Mid-ocean ridges are an example of divergent boundaries. Convergent boundaries are where the plates collide with one another causing the subduction of one plate beneath the other.
Tectonics (from the Late Latin tectonicus from the Greek τεκτονικός, pertaining to building ) is concerned with the processes which control the structure and properties of the Earth's crust, and its evolution through time.
From the deepest ocean trench to the tallest mountain, plate tectonics explains the features and movement of Earth's surface in the present and the past. Plate tectonics is the theory that Earth's outer shell is divided into several plates that glide over the mantle, the rocky inner layer above the core. The plates act like a hard and rigid shell compared to Earth's mantle. This strong outer layer is called the lithosphere.
Wegener didn't have an explanation for how continents could move around the planet, but researchers do now. Plate tectonics is the unifying theory of geology, said Nicholas van der Elst, a seismologist at Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory in Palisades, New York.
The weakness of the asthenosphere allows the tectonic plates to move easily towards a subduction zone. Although subduction is believed to be the strongest force driving plate motions, it cannot be the only force since there are plates such as the North American Plate which are moving, yet are nowhere being subducted.
By definition the word plate in geologic terms means a large slab of solid rock. Tectonics is a part of the Greek root for to build and together the terms define how the Earth's surface is built up of moving plates. The theory of plate tectonics itself says that the Earth's lithosphere is made up individual plates that are broken down into over a dozen large and small pieces of solid rock.
The driving force behind plate tectonics is convection in the mantle. Hot material near the Earth's core rises, and colder mantle rock sinks. It's kind of like a pot boiling on a stove, Van der Elst said.
History of Plate Tectonics. Plate tectonics grew out of a theory that was first developed in the early 20th century by the meteorologist Alfred Wegener. In 1912, Wegener noticed that the coastlines of the east coast of South America and the west coast of Africa seemed to fit together like a jigsaw puzzle.
Where the plates meet, their relative motion determines the type of boundary: convergent, divergent, or transform. Earthquakes, volcanic activity, mountain-building, and oceanic trench formation occur along these plate boundaries. The lateral relative movement of the plates typically ranges from zero to 100 mm annually.
Pick out a rabbit litter box. Purchasing a litter box and training your rabbit to use it is very important if you are having your rabbit live indoors. A triangular litter box to place in the corner of the cage or pen is very convenient. 1  Your rabbit may not use the litter box right away, so be patient.2  You will need to litter box train them. Consider an open-top cage, like a puppy pen. 2  This will give the rabbit more freedom to move around and will feel less confining. 3  Just make sure it is at least 35 inches (88.9 cm) high, so the rabbit cannot jump out. 4  If you want to create an outdoor hutch for your rabbit, the specifications are different.
2. Pick out a cage that is the right size for your rabbit. Rabbits vary widely in size from the tiny mini-lop that weighs just 1.3 kg (2 - 3 lb), to the huge Flemish giant which at up to 10 kg (22 lb). The floor area and height of the cage is going to vary depending on the breed of rabbit your select.

Look for a cage with a solid bottom and sides made out of wire designed for rabbits. Think of this as the “den” for the rabbit to sleep in and a source of food and water. The plan should be that the bunny spends 8-12 hours or so outside of the cage in an exercise pen or a room for bunny-safe exploration.or an average-sized rabbit of 8 pounds or so, you'll need a cage that's at least four feet wide, two feet deep, and two feet tall. The bunny should be able to lay down and stretch out comfortably and still have room for food and water and a litter box.
Once your rabbit is using the litter box consistently in his cage, you may allow him some playtime in a limited area around his cage. If he consistently returns to his litter box while having his exercise time, then once again you can expand his play area.eep the litter box clean – the cleaner you keep the cage and litter box the more likely it is that your rabbit will use it. Some bunnies have the best intentions, but will back up to a corner of the litter box and wind up urinating over the edge.
You may choose to put the litter box in one of the corners and see if he likes your selection or you can wait and see where he are choosing to eliminate and put the litter box in that place. Purchase a large cat litter box, spread a thin layer of the recommended rabbit litter on the bottom and a handful of hay on top.eep the litter box clean – the cleaner you keep the cage and litter box the more likely it is that your rabbit will use it.

You can play with your bunny or leave it to enjoy itself on its own (but keeping an eye on it), but don't neglect this important element of rabbit care. 1  Make sure your rabbit is either fenced in a pen that is at least 1 foot (0.3 m) in the ground and 3 feet (0.9 m) out of the ground, or on a rabbit harness and leash.or an average-sized rabbit of 8 pounds or so, you'll need a cage that's at least four feet wide, two feet deep, and two feet tall.

Your calorie allotment for effective weight loss is 500 to 1,000 fewer calories than your usual daily intake, notes the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. For many adults, this amount is 1,200 to 1,600 calories per day, according to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute.
The little-known weight-loss secret. Eating a diet packed with the right kind of carbs is the little-known secret to getting and staying slim for life. When we talk about the right kind of carbs, we mean Resistant Starch. Hundreds of studies conducted at respected universities and research centers have shown Resistant Starch helps you eat less, burn more calories, feel more energized and less stressed, and lower cholesterol.
1 Let’s pretend you calculated that you need to eat 2000 calories per day to lose weight or build muscle or whatever your goal is. 2  Next let’s pretend you figured out that you need to eat 150 grams of protein per day.
For example, if you’re eating 1,200 calories a day, aim for 135 to 195 grams of carbs -- and if your weight-loss calorie requirement is 1,600 calories daily, shoot for 180, but no more than 260, grams of carbs per day. You Might Also Like.
Therefore, if your weight-loss energy goal is 1,400 calories per day, multiply 1,400 by 0.45 and by 0.65 -- equaling 630 to 910 calories -- to determine how many of your total calories should be from carbohydrates. Then, divide each of these number by 4 calories, which is 157 to 228 grams of carbs per day.
1 Next, since 25% of your calories should come from fat, this example person can calculate that 500 of their 2000 daily calories will come from fat. 2  So that’s 600 from protein plus 500 from fat which gives this person 1100 calories accounted for so far.
Combine healthy carbs with lean protein. Photo Credit Barbara Dudzińska/iStock/Getty Images. Although your total calorie intake determines how much weight – if any -- you’ll lose, your carbohydrate intake can affect how many calories you eat in a day.
One of the most common questions I get asked by people trying to put together the best diet possible for their goal (to lose weight, build muscle, etc.) is how many grams of carbs they should eat per day.
My article comparing good fat vs bad fat also covers how much you should eat per day. To again save you the time, usually about 25% of your total calorie intake should come from fat in most cases.
1 So that’s 600 from protein plus 500 from fat which gives this person 1100 calories accounted for so far. 2  Now they’d just subtract 1100 from their 2000 total and get 900 calories. 3  Since 1 gram of carbs contains 4 calories, this example person can see that they should eat 225 grams of carbs per day.

Function: In the graph of a continuous function, the points are connected with a continuous line, since every point has meaning to the original problem. Function: In the graph of a discrete function, only separate, distinct points are plotted, and only these points have meaning to the original problem. Graph: You can draw a continuous function without lifting your pencil from your paper. Graph: A discrete graph is a series of unconnected points (a scatter plot).
It is both, a bar graph can be for discrete and continuous it depends on how you set out the chart. If it is for discrete data then you have to have a gap between each bar but … on a continuous bar graph they are all next to each other WITHOUT any gaps. Also another way to discover if a bar graph is discrete or continuous the dicrete graph bars are labelled individually but on a continuous they are not labelled as such; there is a scale on the bottom axis. Hope this helps who ever needs it :D
Section 4.2 Discrete and Continuous Domains 157. EXAMPLE 2 Graphing Continuous Data. A cereal bar contains 130 calories. The number c of calories consumed. is a function of the number b of bars eaten. Graph the function.
Continuous. We can imagine half of that distance, or a third, or a fourth, and so on. c) A bag of apples. Discrete. d) Applesauce. Continuous! e) A dozen eggs. Discrete. f) 60 minutes. Continuous. Our idea of time, like our idea of distance, is that there is no smallest unit. g) Pearls on a necklace. Discrete. h) The area of a circle.
Best Answer: Discrete. If a variable can take on any value between two specified values, it is called a continuous variable; otherwise, it is called a discrete variable.. Between $10.99 and $11.00, there is no valid value for cost, so cost cannot take values between those two specified values.
If we suppose that the fundamental level of structure in the physical world is discrete like the set of rational numbers, then it is clearly possible for continuous structures to supervene upon discrete substructures, and for the supervenience to be exact.

When you think of good sources of protein, images of steak, chicken breasts, tofu or raw eggs may come to mind. However, there are many surprisingly good sources of protein in the grocery store that you can use to easily get 25 grams of protein at every meal. For example, in the produce aisle, baked potatoes are decent sources of protein. A medium-sized potato will pack around five grams, but make sure to eat it with the skin on. If meat is on your shopping list, you may want to try buying bison, which has a whopping 20 grams of protein per 3 ounce serving.
The US Department of Agriculture recommends that all men and women over the age of 19 should get at least 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight per day (or 0.37 grams per pound). That means a woman who is 130 pounds should get at least 48 grams of protein, which could look like 7 ounces of salmon or 7 eggs.
That 3-ounce potato, whether you prefer Russet, red bliss or a sweet potato, has about 1.75 to 2.25 grams of protein. Because protein contains 4 calories per gram, this amounts to 7 to 9 calories from protein for a 3-ounce tater.
Because potatoes aren’t particularly rich in protein, they won’t do much to help you meet your protein recommendation. You need at least 56 grams of protein daily, if you’re male, the Food and Nutrition Board notes. As a woman, you should aim for 46 grams a day -- 71 grams if you’re pregnant or nursing. A 3-ounce potato gives you less than 5 percent of your daily protein needs, depending on which demographic you fall into.

In 1959, White Castle expanded into new markets for the first time since the 1920s. Billy Ingram, who had retired to Miami in 1958, built three White Castle restaurants there. The company closed the Florida operations in 1967 due to inefficient supply distribution.

But there’s something about these greasy little burgers that’s unlike anything else out there, and it’s truly a bite of Americana. Nowadays, we may think of White Castle as just another fast food chain, but in reality, it’s anything but. Read on for nine things you didn’t know about White Castle.

Disturbance in function of the temporal lobe may be caused by ischaemic or haemorrhagic damage, as with a cerebrovascular event (CVE). Disturbance of temporal lobe function may also occur with space-occupying lesions and with trauma; it may also be associated with epilepsy.
Frontal Lobe Stroke. Stroke. The effects of a stroke differ depending on which region of the brain is involved. The brain's frontal lobe is relatively large and it controls many important functions in everyday life. A frontal lobe stroke can cause a variety of symptoms and long term effects which range from weakness to lack of motivation.
Early signs of frontotemporal dementia may involve the following symptoms: 1  Apathy or an unwillingness to talk. 2  Change in personality and mood, such as depression. 3  Lack of inhibition or lack of social tact.  Obsessive or repetitive behavior, such as compulsively shaving or collecting 1  items. Unusual verbal, physical or sexual behavior.
Frontal lobe seizures often can be well controlled with medications for partial seizures. If seizure medicines are not effective, vagus nerve stimulation or surgery may be help. The outlook for people with frontal lobe epilepsy varies greatly, depending on the cause of the seizures.
Behavioral Symptoms. Early signs of frontotemporal dementia may involve the following symptoms: Apathy or an unwillingness to talk. Change in personality and mood, such as depression. Lack of inhibition or lack of social tact. Obsessive or repetitive behavior, such as compulsively shaving or collecting items.
Sometimes a person remains fully aware during a frontal lobe seizure while having wild movements of the arms and legs. Because of their strange nature, frontal lobe seizures can be misdiagnosed as nonepileptic seizures. The features of seizures may suggest whether they begin in the frontal or temporal lobes.
Tumors of the frontal lobe may cause weakness on one side of the body, personality or behavior changes, and difficulty with short-term memory. Temporal lobe tumors are usually “silent,” causing few symptoms other than perhaps seizures or language problems.
After temporal lobe epilepsy, frontal lobe epilepsy is the next most common type of epilepsy featuring partial seizures. Frontal lobe epilepsy may run in families. In one rare genetic disorder (called autosomal dominant frontal lobe epilepsy or ADFLE), several individuals in a family typically have seizures during sleep.
There are eight principal symptoms of temporal lobe damage: 1  Disturbance of auditory sensation and perception. 2  Disturbance of selective attention of auditory and visual input. 3  Disorders of visual perception.  Impaired organisation and categorisation of verbal 1  material. Disturbance of language comprehension.  Impaired long-term memory.
The most common cause of temporal lobe lesions is a CVE. Space-occupying lesions may be primary brain tumours - benign (such as meningioma) or malignant. They may also be secondary tumours or metastatic carcinoma, most often from lung cancer or breast cancer.

Placing a Cap on Physician’s Deposition Fees Supreme Court Rule 204(c) allows for physicians to charge “a reasonable fee” for the giving of deposition testimony. As most practitioners are aware, the definition of “reasonable fee” used by most physicians is patently unreasonable.
Can treating physicians charge a fee for a deposition? It depends, but in general, no. If the deposition relates purely to the treatment given, the answer is no. See CCP § 2034.430(2). Unless the deposition is court-ordered, the CCP specifically bars expert witness fees (or even so-called “ordinary witness fees) for treating physicians. See Baker-Hoey v. Lockheed Martin Corp., 111 Cal. App. 4th 592 (CA. Ct. of Appeal—4th Dist., Div. 2, 2003) (citing CCP §1033.5(b)(1)).
Treating physicians are experts and recovery of their fees as costs are accordingly governed by section 1033.5’s provisions [barring] expert witness fees [except in court-appointed cases], not the provisions applicable to ordinary witnesses.” See Baker-Hoey, supra.

According to the text, diversity training has a positive impact when a. training is viewed as a long-term process b. trainers treat all individuals and organizations the same
The Three Elements of Cultural Intelligence. 1  The knowledge of culture and of fundamental principles of cross-cultural interactions. 2  The mindfulness to pay attention to a reflective and creative way to queues in the cross-cultural situation encountered.
The intersection between multiple identities impacts any person’s experience and social opportunities. To work effectively with clients who have disabilities, it is important for psychologists to consider how a client’s disability-related issues interact with his or her other cultural and social identities and experiences.
The current RDA for protein is 0.8 grams per kilogram of body weight per day, or about 0.36 grams of protein per pound of body weight, according to the Institute of Medicine.Consuming the protein RDA can help maintain your lean muscle mass.owever, to build muscle and gain weight the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics recommends you consume 1.4 to 1.8 grams per kilogram, or about 0.64 to 0.82 grams of protein per pound of body weight each day.
1 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight (2.2 g/kg of BW) per day has been a bodybuilding rule of thumb for decades. 2  Higher levels of protein intake, usually in the range of 1.2 – 1.5 grams per pound of body weight (2.6 – 3.3 g/kg BW) per day, are commonly recommended when “cutting” to lose fat. have been trying to bulk with 400 grams of complex carbs (bananas, oatmeal, carb powder) and 1.5 grams protein per body weight. But only seeing slow muscle growth in a 3 month span. The last few months I have been cutting to go on my vacation next week.
Well it seems they concluded that 0.36 grams per kilogram of lean bodyweight in protein is lost per day. With a safety margin in place, it has been bumped up to 0.45 grams per kilogram of lean bodyweight, and then bumped up again to approximately 0.75 grams per kilogram.ow onto the third study; Protein consumption increased from 2.2g/kg/day to 3.5 g/kg/day resulted in a 6% increase in muscle mass and a 5% increase in strength... That is a 60% increase in protein.. Now, if a 80 kg athlete was consuming 2000 calories a day using 2.2 g/kg. He would be consuming 176 g/ kg of protein.
1 The RDA (recommended dietary allowance) for protein is 0.8 grams per kilogram of body weight of adults (or roughly 0.36 grams per lb of body weight).2  Or I have also seen advised that women need at least 46 grams of protein per day, and men need at least 56 grams of protein per day (to avoid deficiency). The RDA (recommended dietary allowance) for protein is 0.8 grams per kilogram of body weight of adults (or roughly 0.36 grams per lb of body weight).
The RDA for infants is 1.5 grams per kilogram, and protein RDAs for children are 0.85 to 1.1 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight, depending on the child’s age.Younger children need more protein per kilogram than older children.he Institute of Medicine’s protein RDAs are calculated using 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight. This means an adult who weighs 68 kilograms needs at least 54 grams of protein each day.
However, to build muscle and gain weight the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics recommends you consume 1.4 to 1.8 grams per kilogram, or about 0.64 to 0.82 grams of protein per pound of body weight each day.owever, to build muscle and gain weight the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics recommends you consume 1.4 to 1.8 grams per kilogram, or about 0.64 to 0.82 grams of protein per pound of body weight each day.
The amount of protein you require per kilogram of body weight depends on your age and activity level. To convert pounds of body weight to kilograms, divide by 2.2. For example, a 150-pound adult weighs 68 kilograms.he Institute of Medicine’s protein RDAs are calculated using 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight. This means an adult who weighs 68 kilograms needs at least 54 grams of protein each day.
0.5-0.7 grams of protein per pound of body weight. Average healthy adult (male or female) that IS doing some form of exercise regularly or IS trying to improve their body (lose fat, build muscle, etc.).This is the minimum I’d recommend in this case. 0.8-1 grams of protein per pound of body weight.Average healthy adult FEMALE whose primary goal is building muscle, getting “toned,” maintaining muscle while losing fat, increasing strength or improving performance. 1-1.2 grams of protein per pound of body weight..5-0.7 grams of protein per pound of body weight. Average healthy adult (male or female) that IS doing some form of exercise regularly or IS trying to improve their body (lose fat, build muscle, etc.).
Hopefully you've been convinced that a high protein intake is not evil.. Protein intake ranging from 1.4 grams of protein per kilogram of bodyweight to one gram per pound or more can be beneficial for an individual involved in an intense training program.ow onto the third study; Protein consumption increased from 2.2g/kg/day to 3.5 g/kg/day resulted in a 6% increase in muscle mass and a 5% increase in strength...

1 Should any one of the Articles of Impeachment be approved by a simple majority vote, the President will be impeached.. 2  However, being impeached is sort of like being indicted of a crime. 3  There still has to be a trial, which is where the US Senate comes in.
In the Senate. 1  The Articles of Impeachment are received from the House. 2  The Senate formulates rules and procedures for holding a trial. 3  A trial will be held. 4  The President will be represented by his lawyers.
1 The Senate, in open session, will vote on a verdict. 2  A 2/3 vote of the Senate will result in a conviction. 3  The Senate will vote to remove the President from office.
1 A 2/3 vote of the Senate will result in a conviction. 2  The Senate will vote to remove the President from office. 3  The Senate may also vote (by a simple majority) to prohibit the President from holding any public office in the future.
Bill Clinton, the 42nd President of the United States, was impeached by the House of Representatives on two charges, one of perjury and one of obstruction of justice, on December 19, 1998.
Two other impeachment articles, a second perjury charge and a charge of abuse of power, failed in the House, and he was acquitted of them by the Senate on February 12, 1999. Independent Counsel Ken Starr turned over documentation to the House Judiciary Committee.
611, Clinton was impeached on December 19, 1998, by the House of Representatives on grounds of perjury to a grand jury (by a 228–206 vote) and obstruction of justice (by a 221–212 vote).
1 The Senate will vote to remove the President from office. 2  The Senate may also vote (by a simple majority) to prohibit the President from holding any public office in the future.
A two-thirds vote (67 senators) was required to remove Clinton from office. Fifty senators voted to remove Clinton on the obstruction of justice charge and 45 voted to remove him on the perjury charge; no Democrat voted guilty on either charge.
As a result, four charges were considered by the full House of Representatives; two passed, making Clinton the second United States President to be impeached, and only the third for whom the House had considered such proceedings (Nixon 's presidency is the only one to be ended in the wake of the impeachment process).
Another drawback is that hydrostatic processes generate a lot of heat which must be shed (hence the fan on the input pulley) or the build up of heat will lead to foaming and burning (carbonizing) of the oil inside the transmission. When the oil foams, hydrostatic processes diminish or stop, and so does the tractor.
Theoretically, the maximum power a hydrostatic transmission can transmit is a function of flow and pressure. However, in constant-power transmissions with variable output speeds, theoretical power divided by the torque/speed ratio determines actual power output.
The primary function of any hydrostatic transmission (HST) is to accept rotary power from a prime mover (usually an internal combustion engine) having specific operating characteristics and transmit that energy to a load having its own operating characteristics.
So, I'm thinking that the bottom line is this.. The hydrostatic is great, but the good ones must have a way of changing the hydraulic fluid and the filter....And it. will be less efficient that the CVT.. The greater efficiency will come at a prive...every 2-3 years $100 to $200 for two new belts.
Hydrostatic transmissions are evolving. Understanding hydrostatic transmissions. The operating principle of HSTs is simple: a pump, connected to the prime mover, generates flow to drive a hydraulic motor, which is connected to the load. If the displacement of the pump and motor are fixed, the HST simply acts as a gearbox to transmit power from the prime mover to the load.
Hydrostatics is the branch of fluid mechanics that studies incompressible fluids at rest. It encompasses the study of the conditions under which fluids are at rest in stable equilibrium as opposed to fluid dynamics, the study of fluids in motion. Hydrostatics are categorized as a part of the fluid statics, which is the study of all fluids, incompressible or not, at rest. Hydrostatics is fundamental to hydraulics, the engineering of equipment for storing, transporting and using fluids.
For example, the absolute pressure compared to vacuum is: where H is the total height of the liquid column above the test area to the surface, and p atm is the atmospheric pressure, i.e., the pressure calculated from the remaining integral over the air column from the liquid surface to infinity.
While one takes a belt form the engine to control a hydraulic pump to drive the wheels and the other takes a belt to drive a varying wheel to drive the wheel like a CVT transmission in a car. I understand the belt and pulley automatic is far less complicated.
The combined case drains flow to the reservoir through a heat exchanger. One of the most important components in a closed-circuit HST is a charge pump. The charge pump is usually an integral part of the main pump package but can also be an independent pump gang-mounted with the drive pumps it serves, Figure 6.
In a fluid at rest, all frictional stresses vanish and the state of stress of the system is called hydrostatic. When this condition of (V=0) is applied to the Navier-Stokes equation, the gradient of pressure becomes a function of body forces only.

The Louisiana Purchase stretched from the Mississippi River in the east to the Rocky Mountains in the west. Its southernmost tip was the port city of New Orleans and the Gulf of Mexico. To the North it included much of Minnesota, North Dakota, and Montana up to the border of Canada.
With the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, the United States purchased a large area of land from the French. It was the single largest purchase of land ever by the United States and doubled the size of the country.
On April 30, 1803, U.S. representatives in Paris agreed to pay $15 million for about 828,000 square miles of land that stretched from the Mississippi River to the Rocky Mountains and from the Gulf of Mexico to Canada. This deal, known as the Louisiana Purchase, nearly doubled the size of the United States.
At the time, many leaders in the United States were against the Louisiana Purchase. They thought that Thomas Jefferson didn't have the right to make such a large purchase of land and that we would soon be at war with Spain over the land. The purchase was nearly cancelled by Congress and only passed by the vote of 59-57.
Therefore, Jefferson sent envoys to France to try and secure its purchase. Instead, they returned with an agreement to buy the entire Louisiana Territory. America did not have the money to pay the $15 million outright so they instead borrowed the money from Great Britain at 6% interest.
By Martin Kelly. The Louisiana Purchase was one of the largest land deals in history. In 1803, the United States paid approximately $15 million dollars for over 800,000 square miles of land.
1 Some historians claim that Napoleon had no right to sell the Louisiana Territory to the United States. 2  The issue of slavery in the western lands of the Louisiana Purchase became a major issue in later years and part of the cause of the American Civil War.
Importance of the Louisiana Purchase. With the purchase of this new territory, the land area of America nearly doubled. However, the exact southern and western boundaries were not defined in the purchase. America would have to deal with Spain to work out the specific details of these boundaries.
The Louisiana Purchase, made 200 years ago this month, nearly doubled the size of the United States. By any measure, it was one of the most colossal land transactions in history, involving an area larger than today’s France, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Germany, Holland, Switzerland and the British Isles combined.
When Thomas Jefferson purchased the Louisiana Territory from France, he altered the shape of a nation and the course of history. The Louisiana Purchase nearly doubled the size of the United States and the cost of about four cents an acre was a breathtaking bargain. (The Granger Collection, New York). By Joseph Harriss.
PRI-724 is a potent, specific inhibitor of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway in cancer stem cells with potential antineoplastic activity. PRI-724 specifically inhibits the recruiting of beta-catenin with its coactivator CBP.
Tifacogin, developed by Chiron, is a recombinant form of tissue factor pathway inhibitor, or TFPI, a naturally occurring protein in the body. Tifacogin is a recombinant form of tissue factor pathway inhibitor, or TFPI.
Other tyrosine kinase inhibitors are more specialized. Sorafenib (Nexavar) targets a complex pathway that would lead to a kinase signaling cascade. Nilotinib (Tasinga) inhibits the fusion protein bcr-abl and is typically prescribed when a patient has shown resistance to imatinib.
Biology of tissue factor pathway inhibitor. Abstract. Recent studies of the anticoagulant activities of the tissue factor (TF) pathway inhibitor (TFPI) isoforms, TFPIα and TFPIβ, have provided new insight into the biochemical and physiological mechanisms that underlie bleeding and clotting disorders.
IWR-1-endo is a Wnt pathway inhibitor with IC50 of 180 nM in L-cells expressing Wnt3A, induces Axin2 protein levels and promotes β-catenin phosphorylation by stabilizing Axin-scaffolded destruction complexes.
Tissue factor (TF) pathway inhibitor (TFPI) is the primary inhibitor of the initiation of blood coagulation and modulates the severity of a wide variety of bleeding and clotting disorders.
Kinase Inhibitors. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are a class of chemotherapy medications that inhibit, or block, the enzyme tyrosine kinase. TKIs were created out of modern genetics- the understanding of DNA, the cell cycle, and molecular signaling pathways- and thus represent a change from general to molecular methods of cancer treatment.
IWP-2 is an inhibitor of Wnt processing and secretion with IC50 of 27 nM in a cell-free assay, selective blockage of Porcn-mediated Wnt palmitoylation, does not affect Wnt/β-catenin in general and displays no effect against Wnt-stimulated cellular responses.
The expression of tissue factor and tissue factor pathway inhibitor in prostate cancer cells themselves is unlikely to be the source of hypercoagulability in patients, but might precipitate chains of events that would produce such an effect.
This gene encodes a Kunitz-type serine protease inhibitor that regulates the tissue factor (TF)-dependent pathway of blood coagulation. The coagulation process initiates with the formation of a factor VIIa-TF complex, which proteolytically activates additional proteases (factors IX and X) and ultimately leads to the formation of a fibrin clot.
Anemia of inflammation or chronic disease. Anemia of inflammation chronic disease is the most common cause of anemia in the elderly. Numerous diseases have inflammation as a consequence; in the elderly some of the more common include acute or chronic infections, arthritis or malignancy.hen anemia is present in older persons it is likely due to some underlying condition that requires further investigation or therapy. Key to understanding anemia in the elderly is the distinction between anemia caused by iron deficiency or anemia caused by inflammation—often called anemia of chronic disease.
Cohort studies 2, 5 of the elderly have found that the two most common causes of anemia in the elderly are chronic disease and iron deficiency (Table 15) . In 15 to 25 percent of elderly patients with anemia, no cause is found; even when no cause is found the prognosis is good.hile studies suggest that vitamin B 12 (cobalamin) deficiency is the cause of anemia in 5 to 10 percent of elderly patients, the actual prevalence of vitamin B 12 deficiency is likely to be much higher in the elderly. 4, 23 Vitamin B 12 deficiency is difficult to detect in the elderly.
(See Table 1, below.) Moreover, the anemia may be multifactorial. Nevertheless, in the majority of cases of anemia in elderly persons, an etiology can be found. The most common causes include iron deficiency (with or without blood loss), chronic disease/inflammation, and chronic kidney disease.hronic kidney disease is an important cause of anemia in elderly persons, especially considering that renal function declines with aging. Reduced renal EPO production is the primary factor leading to anemia in chronic kidney disease.
A cause is found in approximately 80 percent of elderly patients. The most common causes of anemia in the elderly are chronic disease and iron deficiency. Vitamin B 12 deficiency, folate deficiency, gastrointestinal bleeding and myelodysplastic syndrome are among other causes of anemia in the elderly.Serum ferritin is the most useful test to differentiate iron deficiency anemia from anemia of chronic disease.hile studies suggest that vitamin B 12 (cobalamin) deficiency is the cause of anemia in 5 to 10 percent of elderly patients, the actual prevalence of vitamin B 12 deficiency is likely to be much higher in the elderly. 4, 23 Vitamin B 12 deficiency is difficult to detect in the elderly.

There are many different causes and types of anemia. Iron-deficiency anemia, the most common type, is usually treated with dietary changes and iron supplement pills. Other types of anemia, such as those associated with chronic diseases or cancer, may need more aggressive treatment.ost cases of anemia are mild, including those that occur as a result of chronic disease. Nevertheless, even mild anemia can reduce oxygen transport in the blood, causing fatigue and a diminished physical capacity. Moderate-to-severe iron-deficiency anemia is known to reduce endurance.
Anemia of chronic disease is usually a mild or moderate condition. In mild cases, anemia may not be associated with any symptoms or may cause fatigue, paleness of the skin (pallor) and lightheadedness.The underlying mechanisms that cause anemia of chronic disease are complex and not fully understood.eneral Discussion. Anemia of chronic disease is a condition that can be associated with many different underlying disorders including chronic illnesses such as cancer, certain infections, and autoimmune and inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus.
Iron-deficiency anemia. Iron-deficiency is the second most common cause of anemia in the elderly. The most foremost reasons for iron deficiency in this age group are blood loss, nutritional deficiencies, medications, cancer therapies and poor absorption.hen anemia is present in older persons it is likely due to some underlying condition that requires further investigation or therapy. Key to understanding anemia in the elderly is the distinction between anemia caused by iron deficiency or anemia caused by inflammation—often called anemia of chronic disease.
The most common form of anemia in older adults is anemia of chronic disease (or disorder), also referred to as ACD. With ACD, there is sufficient iron present in the body, but the bone marrow is unable to incorporate it into the red blood cells.he most common form of anemia in older adults is anemia of chronic disease (or disorder), also referred to as ACD.

Lou Ferrigno was born in Brooklyn, New York, to Victoria and Matt Ferrigno, a police lieutenant. He is of Italian descent. Soon after he was born, Ferrigno says he believes he suffered a series of ear infections and lost 75 to 80% of his hearing, though his condition was not diagnosed until he was three years old.
After the show was canceled, Bixby and Cruz remained in contact, with Cruz making a guest appearance on Bixby's later series The Incredible Hulk. The death of Bixby's only child, in 1981, drew Bixby and Cruz closer still. The two would remain in touch until Bixby's death in 1993.

A veteran (from Latin vetus, meaning old) is a person who has had long service or experience in a particular occupation or field. This page refers to military veterans, i.e., a person who has served or is serving in the armed forces.
Additional information is available from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), another government resource that provides information on programs and benefits for veterans, and locations of VA facilities worldwide.
Length of Service Criteria for Veteran Status. For people who enlisted prior to September 8, 1980, no minimum length of service is necessary to. be considered a veteran for most VA benefits. However, certain minimum length of service. requirements apply to people who enlisted on or after September 8, 1980. The general.
The Protected Class of Veteran Status. Definition. Employment: The U.S. Department of Labor defines a person with “veteran status” as “… a person who served on active duty for a period of more than 180 days, any part of which occurred between August 5, 1964 and May 7, 1975, and was discharged or released with other than a dishonorable discharge.”.
To be eligible for most VA benefits, the claimant must be a veteran or, in some circumstances, the. survivor or the dependent of a veteran. By statute, a veteran is defined as a “person who served in. the active military, naval, or air service, and who was discharged or released therefrom under.
Veteran Status Discrimination Law and Legal Definition. Veteran status discrimination is a form of discrimination in violation of federal and/or state law involving harassment based upon veteran status. This form of discrimination may be inadvertent or intentional, and it may be obvious or subtle. But regardless of those facts it is in many cases against the law.
Definition of a Veteran. Eligibility. To be eligible for veterans' benefits, one must be a veteran or a dependent of a veteran under M.G.L. c. 4, sec. 7, cl. 43rd as amended by the Acts of 2005, ch. 130. See below for service requirements and exceptions.
Different countries handle this differently: some openly support veterans through government programs, while others ignore them. Veterans are also subject to illnesses directly related to their military service such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
After a series of celebrated accounting debacles, Congress enacted the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (or Act), 116 Stat. 745. Among other measures, the Act introduced tighter regulation of the accounting industry under a new Public Company Accounting Oversight Board.
By granting the Board executive power without the Executive’s oversight, this Act subverts the President’s ability to ensure that the laws are faithfully executed—as well as the public’s ability to pass judgment on his efforts. The Act’s restrictions are incompatible with the Constitution’s separation of powers.

The Court holds unconstitutional a statute providing that the Securities and Exchange Commission can remove members of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board from office only for cause. It argues that granting the inferior officer[s] on the Accounting Board more than one level of good-cause protection ... contravenes the President's 'constitutional obligation to ensure the faithful execution of the laws.'

Yes, you have employment for four years, but it’s employment that you don’t like and which isn’t paying you what you’re worth somewhere else. So you’d be signing up for four years of low quality of life. (There’s also no certainty that you’ll be secure there for four years, despite the contract.
Job Searching. An employment contract is a signed agreement between an employee and employer. It establishes both the rights and responsibilities of the two parties: the worker and the boss. Read below for more information on what is included in an employment contract, and the pros and cons of a contract.
Job candidates may think that contract or temporary work means that their search for a permanent job is on hold. They worry about taking themselves off the job market without a permanent position. This is not always true. Simply put, contract positions do not have to be mutually exclusive with a permanent search.
Take the contract job. The security of the job you have now is moot if it doesn't pay enough to cover your expenses. (And, really, job security is a thing of the past. You could lose either job at any time, for any reason.) We hire people for contract jobs all of the time.
Today we’re tackling what job seekers need to know about contract-to-hire jobs. A contract-to-hire job can be a win-win for both the employer and employee. These are short-term opportunities typically varying from anywhere from three months up to a year, with the opportunity to become full-time, permanent jobs at the end of the contract.
contract employee. An employee who works under contract for an employer. A contract employee is hired for a specific job at a specific rate of pay. A contract employee does not become a regular addition to the staff and is not considered a permanent employee. Use 'contract employee' in a Sentence.
What does at-will employment mean? Many people are surprised to learn, whether from an employment contract or employee handbook, that they are an at-will employee.. This means that your employer can terminate you at any time, for any cause -- with or without notice.
What is Included in an Employment Contract. Also known as a contract of employment or employment agreement, an employment contract lays out the rights and responsibilities of both employer and employee. Salary or wages: Contracts will itemize the salary, wage, or commission that has been agreed upon.
That’s a good question. Contract positions are a great opportunity often overlooked by job candidates. Don’t let any of these myths about contract positions make you miss a real opportunity to get a job in accounting, finance, or any other industry. Myth #1: You Can’t Keep Searching for a Job.
Best Answer: Yes, it means you sign a contract and that it's a temporary job. There are two types of contract jobs. One type is through a contracting agency, like an employment agency. You get a paycheck from them and sometimes benefits. taxes are withheld, just like you're an employee. The other type is independent contracting.

V.2. Recommendations On a broad level, the recommendation is to maintain and promote Kodak’scorporate emphasis on cycle time reduction. Rapid cycle times provide a competitiveweapon for satisfying the customer, reducing cost, and improving quality.
Critical WIP is deﬁned to be W o = r b T o .Example 1: Consider a production line with four stations, and assume that the processing time ateach workstation is two hours. Since the processing rate at each of the workstations is 0. 5partsperhour, it follows that r b =0. 5.
Another opportunity for future work is to put the responsibility for cycle time. reduction in the hands of the operators. As the people closest to the detailed work, theyare in the best position to eliminate non-value added transactions, streamline procedures, and improve production techniques.
Cycle Time Reduction at Kodak Eastman Kodak Company has recognized these benefits of cycle time reductionand has instituted programs throughout the organization in its efforts toward continuousimprovement.
In a push system we need to determine TH to maximize the proﬁt function. In a pull system we would control w to maximize the system.For the above problem, the PUSH proﬁt function becomes pTH −h 5 TH 1 −TH, while for a pull system the proﬁt function becomes pw 4+ w−hw.
Direct deposit transactions from your Bank of America ® credit card account to a deposit account outside of Bank of America are fulfilled via an automated clearing house and may take up to five days to process.
Yes, you can do all of these things online: 1  Get a summary of your current account status, including balance, available credit and payment information. 2  Request up to 12 months of detailed transaction information. 3  View and print up to 18 months of credit card statements.
In this case, you expect to see w− 1 N jobs ahead ofyou. If the processing time at each station is T o /N then the time you spend at each station is equalto T o N (1+ w− 1 N). Multiplying by N we obtain the cycle time CT = T o (1+ w− 1 N) . Using Little’s Law we can ﬁnd the throughput TH = wCT = wW o + w− 1 r b, wherewe haveused the factthat W o = r b T o.

The voluminous black robe of a Benedictine monk (and daughter orders of the Benedictines: e.g. Cistercians, Trappists, Carthusians) is called a cucula. It is given during the final profession of vows, and is worn for solemn religious services, but is optional most of the time.
The longer answer is a little more complicated. The priest is not wearing robes, he is wearing vestments, one of which is a robe. The various vestments worn at Mass are all rooted in the men's formal dress attire from the first three centuries, the Church is very conservative and changes very little and that slowly.

A: The standard tip for all beauty services is 20 percent—whether it’s a manicure, massage, blowout, or haircut. “One thing that people often forget is that the cost of a service is actually the cost of the service, plus the tip,” says LearnVest Editor in Chief and personal finance guru Carrie Sloan.
For a Haircut or Color Service. If you are in a salon, plan to add a 20% tip, says Clara Leonard, hairstylist for Book Your Look, who adds, you can always ask the front desk what the standard is.. Note: Many stylists prefer cash so their tip is separate from the bill — and it isn't taxed.
The acceptable tip for food servers, cocktail servers and bartenders is 15%-20% of the total bill. Keep this tipping advice in mind: If you can't afford $20 for your meal including a gratuity, you probably can't afford $15 for just the meal. If you received bad service, don’t skip out on the gratuity.

A: Depending on the price point of your salon, you’ll want to give your stylist $5 to $20 for a complimentary bang trim. If you’re unsure, play it safe by tipping your stylist the equivalent of 20 percent of a full haircut.
Definition and Principles of Unity of Command. Unity of command provides that an employee is responsible to only one supervisor, who in turn is responsible to only one supervisor, and so on up the organizational hierarchy. This is true even if the top of the organization is led by a group of people.
Unity of command is ensuring unity of effort under one responsible person (or commander) for completing a task. This unity of command is one of the twelve principles of joint operations, and is defined as:
The principle of unity of command is applied throughout the world today in organizations ranging from the military, government bureaucracies and companies, from a small business all the way up to multinational corporations.
Quick Answer. Unity of command is a military principle that has been applied to business. It follows the idea that a subordinate should have only one person to whom they are directly responsible. In business, this means that no employee should ever have more than one boss. Continue Reading.
As a team effort, Unified Command. overcomes much of the inefficiency and duplication of effort that can occur when agencies. from different functional and geographic jurisdictions, or agencies at different levels of. government, operate without a common system or organizational framework.
The content of the IAP is organized by a number of standardized ICS forms that allow for accurate and precise documentation of an incident.National Incident Management System (NIMS) Incident Command System (ICS) Forms Booklet (PDF).
ICS basic organization chart (ICS-100 level depicted) The Incident Command System (ICS) is a standardized approach to the command, control, and coordination of emergency response providing a common hierarchy within which responders from multiple agencies can be effective.
Unified Command uses one set of incident objectives and a single planning process, and. produces one Incident Action Plan (IAP). The planning process for Unified Command is. similar to the process used on single jurisdiction incidents.
American Military Principles. This unity of command is one of the twelve principles of joint operations, and is defined as: Unity of command means that all forces operate under a single commander with the requisite authority to direct all forces employed in pursuit of a common purpose.
Unity of command is a classic principle of management that is used in many hierarchical organizations, such as the military, government agencies, and corporations. Unity of command holds that an employee should only be answerable to one person.
When to use Objects. 1  JavaScript does not support associative arrays. 2  You should use objects when you want the element names to be strings (text). 3  You should use arrays when you want the element names to be numbers.
The Array.from() method creates a new Array instance from an array-like or iterable object. const bar = [a, b, c]; Array.from(bar); // [a, b, c] Array.from('foo'); // [f, o, o]
JavaScript syntax. The syntax of JavaScript is the set of rules that define a correctly structured JavaScript program. The examples below make use of the log function of the console object present in most browsers for standard text output. The JavaScript standard library lacks an official standard text output function.
Advanced Javascript: Objects, Arrays, and Array-Like objects. Javascript objects and arrays are both incredibly useful. They're also incredibly easy to confuse with each other. Mix in a few objects that look like arrays and you’ve got a recipe for confusion!
The JavaScript Array object is a global object that is used in the construction of arrays; which are high-level, list-like objects. Create an Array. var fruits = ['Apple', 'Banana']; console.log(fruits.length); // 2. Access (index into) an Array item.
Multidimensional arrays in Javascript. Javascript has no inbuilt support for multidimensional arrays, however the language is flexible enough that you can emulate this behaviour easily by populating your arrays with separate arrays, creating a multi-level structure. You can create an array in Javascript simply by doing any of the following:
Accessing array elements. JavaScript arrays are zero-indexed: the first element of an array is at index 0, and the last element is at the index equal to the value of the array's length property minus 1.
An array is a special variable, which can hold more than one value at a time. If you have a list of items (a list of car names, for example), storing the cars in single variables could look like this:
JS HOME JS Introduction JS Where To JS Output JS Syntax JS Statements JS Comments JS Variables JS Operators JS Arithmetic JS Assignment JS Data Types JS Functions JS Objects JS Scope JS Events JS Strings JS String Methods JS Numbers JS Number Methods JS Math JS Random JS Dates JS Date Formats JS Date Methods JS Arrays JS Array Methods JS Array Sort ...
Array from a Set. var s = new Set(['foo', window]); Array.from(s); // [foo, window] Array from a Map. var m = new Map([[1, 2], [2, 4], [4, 8]]); Array.from(m); // [[1, 2], [2, 4], [4, 8]] Array from an Array-like object (arguments) function f() { return Array.from(arguments); } f(1, 2, 3); // [1, 2, 3]
After the blood gets oxygen in the lungs, it is called oxygen-rich blood. Oxygen-rich blood flows from the lungs back into the left atrium (LA), or the left upper chamber of the heart, through four pulmonary veins. Oxygen-rich blood then flows through the mitral valve (MV) into the left ventricle (LV), or the left lower chamber.
Pulmonary Valve. The pulmonary heart valve separates the right ventricle from the pulmonary artery, which transports deoxygenated blood to the lungs. As deoxygenated blood leaves the right ventricle, it passes through the pulmonary heart valve, which has been closed as the right ventricle was filling. The pulmonary heart valve opens, allowing deoxygenated blood to leave the right ventricle and flow to the lungs via the pulmonary artery.
Pulmonary valve stenosis can cause a heart murmur. A heart murmur sounds like an extra click, blowing, whooshing, or rasping sound when a doctor listens to your heart. The murmur can be an initial indicator of pulmonary valve stenosis. It may be a sign that further testing is required.
Blood Flow Through the Heart. 1  Oxygen-poor blood returns from the body to the heart through the superior vena cava (SVC) and inferior vena cava (IVC), the two main veins that bring blood back to the heart. 2  The oxygen-poor blood enters the right atrium (RA), or the right upper chamber of the heart. From there, the blood flows through the tricuspid valve (TV) into the right ventricle (RV), or the right lower chamber of the heart. The right ventricle (RV) pumps oxygen-poor blood through the pulmonary valve (PV) into the main pulmonary artery (MPA).
Pulmonary valve stenosis affects the body’s ability to get oxygenated blood. Many children do not show symptoms until adulthood. Examples of pulmonary valve stenosis symptoms include: heart murmur; prominent and enlarged jugular vein; bluish tint to the skin ; chest pain; fainting; heart palpitations; unexplained fatigue; failure to thrive; difficulty breathing
Pulmonary valve stenosis is a rare, potentially serious cardiac condition. Learn how it affects the heart and how it's treated. Pulmonary valve stenosis is a rare, potentially serious cardiac condition.
As blood travels through the body, oxygen is used up, and the blood becomes oxygen poor. 1  Oxygen-poor blood returns from the body to the heart through the superior vena cava (SVC) and inferior vena cava (IVC), the two main veins that bring blood back to the heart.
Many children do not show symptoms until adulthood. Examples of pulmonary valve stenosis symptoms include: heart murmur; prominent and enlarged jugular vein; bluish tint to the skin ; chest pain; fainting; heart palpitations; unexplained fatigue; failure to thrive; difficulty breathing; Pulmonary valve stenosis can cause sudden death in severe instances.
Pulmonary Valve The pulmonary heart valve separates the right ventricle from the pulmonary artery, which transports deoxygenated blood to the lungs. As deoxygenated blood leaves the right ventricle, it passes through the pulmonary heart valve, which has been closed as the right ventricle was filling.
Once the right ventricle has emptied, the pulmonary heart valve closes, thereby keeping the blood from reentering the right ventricle. From here, the blood travels through the lungs, where it is oxygenated and then returned to the left atrium.

Pour 1 cup warm water into a medium bowl; add sugar and sprinkle with yeast. Let stand until foamy, 5 minutes. Whisk oil and 1 teaspoon salt into yeast mixture. Add flour and stir with a wooden spoon until liquid is incorporated (dough will appear dry). Turn out onto a floured work surface.
Let it rest 15 minutes before stretching. The best, sturdiest pizza dough shouldn't be tacky. If you've got some bread flour handy, try making your dough with that. You may not get a fluffy, airy dough, but that's okay; you're trying to keep the grilling process as simple as possible.
Mama Mary’s Pizza Crust is the base of any meal. All you have to do is add your favorite toppings and Voila! your pizza is a custom creation! Check out these recipes for inspiration! Feta & Veggie Pizza. Chicken Fajita Pizza. Feta & Hummus Pizza.
To make a basic pizza dough, dissolve a packet of yeast and 1 1/2 teaspoons of sugar in 1 cup of warm water, add 1 teaspoon of salt and 2 tablespoons of olive oil, and knead in 2 1/4 cups of flour. Let the dough rise for 30 minutes.
Do an honest check of the amount of real estate on your grill. Smaller pieces of dough are easier to flip. (Plus, mini pizzas are awfully cute.) If there's one side of your dough that's prettier or smoother, grill that side first. When you flip the dough over, that will be the top of the pizza.
Steps. 1  1. Evaluate your barbecue. 2  2. Prepare and preheat the grill. 3  3. Start with a fairly thin crust.  4. Slice the toppings thinly and choose flavorful 1  toppings. 5. Place your pizza onto a peel.  6. Watch your pizza 1  cook. 7. Remove the pizza once cooked to your satisfaction and serve without  delay.
Proof for ten minutes, or until frothy. Mix in the salt, olive oil, and flour until dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl. Turn onto a lightly floured surface. Knead until smooth, about 8 minutes. Place dough in a well oiled bowl, and cover with a damp cloth. Set aside to rise until doubled, about 1 hour. Punch down, and knead in garlic and basil. Set aside to rise for 1 more hour, or until doubled again. Preheat grill for high heat. Heat olive oil with garlic for 30 seconds in the microwave.
Prepare and preheat the grill. A little preparation makes for much more even heat and a better pizza. The big issue/virtue with barbecues is the smoke factor that gives that smoky flavour to food. If the barbecue is not clean it will smoke the food too much and your pizza will not taste of anything aside from smoke.
This foolproof dough recipe can be used to make a delicious homemade pizza on the grill or in the oven. Try the following topping variations: Grilled Asparagus and Ricotta; Fontina, Fennel, and Onion; Three-Cheese; Shrimp and Pesto; Sausage and Olives; Tomato and Basil. Prep: 1 hour. Total Time: 1 hour 45 mins.
Grill, cook, slice, and grate whatever toppings you like first—more on the best in the minute—and have them at the ready. You'll be adding them as the pizza is grilling, and the dough will only cook 1-2 minutes per side. High-quality olive oil is also a must-have for the tastiest crust.
Employment of kindergarten and elementary school teachers is projected to grow 6 percent from 2014 to 2024, about as fast as the average for all occupations. Growth is expected because of projected increases in student enrollment. However, employment growth will vary by region.
Kindergarten and elementary school teachers typically do the following: 1  Create lesson plans to teach students subjects, such as reading, science, social studies, and math. 2  Teach students how to study and communicate with others. 3  Observe students to evaluate their abilities, strengths, and weaknesses.
Kindergarten and elementary school teachers generally teach kindergarten through fifth grade. However, in some schools, elementary school teachers may teach sixth, seventh, and eighth grade. Kindergarten and elementary school students spend most of their day in one classroom.
The median annual wage for kindergarten teachers, except special education was $52,620 in May 2016. The median annual wage for elementary school teachers, except special education was $55,800 in May 2016.

All states require public kindergarten and elementary school teachers to have at least a bachelor’s degree in elementary education. Private schools typically have the same requirement. Some states also require public kindergarten and elementary school teachers to major in a content area, such as math or science.
Kindergarten and elementary school teachers need to be able to explain difficult concepts in terms that young students can understand. In addition, they must be able to get students engaged in learning and adapt their lessons to meet students’ needs.
I have picked 7 chemicals, molecules, or objects (the distinction between these terms is not always clear) and calculated a (very) approximate radius (in nm), the diffusion coefficient (in SI units times 10 12) and the time in seconds required to diffuse 10 microns (the diameter of a typical animal cell).
The same energy that produces the movement of the ink particles causes diffusion of molecules. When a gradient exists, if there is no membrane blocking particle movement, diffusion will ultimately result in a uniform distribution.  Place about 50 ml of water in a small beaker.
Diffusion is a process leading to equalization of substance concentrations in a system or establishing in a system an equilibrium concentration distribution that results from random migration of the system's elements. Three types of diffusion are distinguished, viz., molecular, Brownian, and turbulent.
The net diffusion of water through a selectively permeable membrane from the side of high water concentration to the side of low water concentration is termed osmosis. The higher the concentration of solute (dissolved particles), the lower the concentration of free water molecules.
Diffusion is one of the fundamental processes by which material moves. It is thus important in biology and medicine, chemistry and geology, engineering and physics, and in just about every aspect of our lives. Diffusion is a consequence of the constant thermal motion of atoms, molecules, and particles, and results in material moving from areas of high to low concentration.
Diffusion and passive transport: Molecules are in constant motion, moving around randomly (Brownian movement). One result of this random motion is diffusion, the net movement of molecules from an area where their concentration is high to an area where their concentration is lower.
Remember the definition of diffusion. Water is more concentrated outside the cell, so it will move into the cell (from 100% concentration to 90% concentration). In this case, the protein molecules are too large to pass out of the cell membrane.
1. temperature 2. size (mass) of the diffusing particles 3. viscosity of the environment. Of course there are also processes that generate inhomogeneity, even while diffusion is smoothing things out, and the world we live in is the sum of both.
Diffusion can thus be described in terms of many particles, i.e. changes in concentration of these particles as time progresses, or it can be discussed in terms of the movement of one particle. We will first focus on the behavior of a single particle, and then move on to systems with a large number of particles.
Diffusion across a differentially permeable membrane: Dialysis Dialysis is the diffusion of solute molecules across a differentially permeable membrane. The cell membrane is differentially permeable. Thus, through dialysis, certain substances may enter a cell, and certain metabolic products, including wastes, may leave.

my pain is on the back side of my left hip. I don’t know why all of a sudden it hurts. its not worse I think (or hope) because it only triggers momentarily. by the way, I have I don’t know if it’s in the muscle or bone but it hurts anyway, on the same, left side too. it really hurts when I bend my left leg.
Non-surgical treatment should always be considered first when treating hip pain. The discomfort can often be resolved with rest, modifying one’s behavior, and a physical therapy and/or anti-inflammatory regimen. Such conservative treatments have been successful in reducing the pain and swelling in the joint.
An x-ray can reveal an excess of bone on the femoral head or neck and the acetabular rim. An MRI can reveal fraying or tears of the cartilage and labrum. Sometimes it is necessary to find a way to differentiate pain radiating from the hip joint and pain radiating from the lower back or abdomen.
Femoro-acetabular impingement (FAI) occurs when the ball (head of the femur) does not have its full range of motion within the socket (acetabulum of the pelvis). This causes a decreased range of hip joint motion, in addition to pain.
If the source of your pain is difficult to pinpoint, seek help from a hip or spine specialist. The specialist may order an injection of lidocaine, or they may perform diagnostic/therapeutic hip injection under fluoroscopy or ultrasound.
An examination will help to determine what’s causing the soreness, since hip pain can actually come from the hip as well as the spine, pelvis or leg. While waiting to see your physician, there are activity modifications and exercises that may help to relieve some of the discomfort. View activities and exercises.
Avascular necrosis, or AVN, is a serious condition marked by death of hip bone at the joint. The pain is usually worse and far more constant than in osteoarthritis. “People come to me saying, ‘My hip is killing me,’” says Dr. Murray.
1 If the pain is coming from the hip joint, the injection provides the patient with pain relief. 2  The injection serves to identify the point of origin of the pain. 3  If the pain is a result of impingement, a hip injection that relieves pain confirms that the pain is from the hip and not from the back.
Causes of Hip pain listed in Disease Database: Other medical conditions listed in the Disease Database as possible causes of Hip pain as a symptom include: 1  Aseptic necrosis of bone. 2  Fracture, neck of femur. 3  Hip dysplasia, congenital. 4  Juvenile osteochondrosis of head of femur. 5  Multiple epiphyseal dysplasia. 6  Osteochondritis dissecans. 7  Slipped upper femoral epiphysis.
Surprisingly, hip problems usually produce groin pain on the affected side. That’s because the actual joint of the hip is near the spine. “Groin pain is a hip issue until proven otherwise,” says back pain specialist Russell DeMicco, DO. “Pain above the belt line is not a hip issue.”. The most common cause of hip pain is osteoarthritis of the hip joint.

Mauricio and Kyle may seem like the perfect couple, but, much like many celebrity couples, they have had to deal with cheating allegations. Many of their fellow cast members on the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills said they wouldn’t believe Mauricio to cheat for even a second. In April 2013, a source told Star:
In addition to her not stacking up to the likes of Lisa Vanderpump, Camille Grammer, and Adrienne Maloof, who have all starred on the series at one point or another, Richards’ net worth is also substantially less than her younger sister, Kyle Richards. Bustle claims Kyle’s net worth is a whopping $30 million, according to CelebrityNetWorth, and she makes a reported $270,000 per episode of the show, while Richards rakes in just $100,000. Although it is normal for stars of the Bravo series to make different amounts, the amounts normally differ based on how long they’ve been on the show and whether or not they appear full-time.

RE: Does your temperature rise/drop before or after your period? I am charting my basal temp for the first time this month. I know that my temp rises 1-2 days after ovulation. But I am wondering when the menstral change occurs-before or after my period and does it rise or fall?
Relax: Excellent that you monitor your B/P. The change you are noticing is a slight variant but normal reflection of the hormonal influences on your blood pressure during your cycle. The diastolic, (second number), is the most important long term and you should seek care if it routinely goes above 90 to 100.
Before ovulation, early morning temperatures typically range from about 97 degrees to 97.5 degrees Fahrenheit (36.11 to 36.38 degrees Celsius), and after ovulation, they usually rise to about 97.6 degrees to 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit (36.44 to 37 Celsius).
It’s helpful to use a special basal or digital thermometer to get readings that are precise enough to track such small changes. After ovulation, your temperature usually remains elevated until your next period, about two weeks later. But if you become pregnant, it remains high for more than 18 days. The important concept to understand is your pattern of low and high temperatures. Your temperatures before ovulation fluctuate in a low range, and the temperatures after ovulation fluctuate in a higher range.
Best Answer: It really depends upon the person. Your temp will fall, but some women experience a gradual fall a few days before...others may see a drop the day OF, the day BEFORE, etc. It really depends. You can't bank on post-ovulatory temps, alone, to determine if you are pregnant. It just doesn't work that way.

1 The time from a woman’s period until ovulation varies, but it is often about two weeks. 2  Sperm can live in fertile-quality cervical fluid for up to five days, though typically they live only about two days.
The easiest way to estimate when you'll ovulate is to count back. First, figure out what day your next period will probably start. (If your period is very irregular, this method won't work for you.). From that day, count back 12 days and then another four. You're most likely to ovulate during this five-day range. If you're one of the many women who have a 28-day cycle, there's a good chance you’ll ovulate on day 14. (Day 1 is the first day of your period; day 28 is the last day before day 1 of your next period.). Get help counting the days.

(Your basal body temperature, or BBT, is your lowest body temperature in a 24-hour period.) This tiny uptick is only 0.4 to 1.0 degree Fahrenheit. You can detect it by taking your BBT every morning with a special thermometer.
A position, resembling that of the fetus in the womb, sometimes adopted by a child or adult in a state of distress or withdrawal. The position is one in which the body is drawn into itself. The head is bent forward, the spine is curved, the arms are crossed over the chest and the hips and knees are fully bent (flexed).
Certain terms are used to describe your baby's position and movement through the birth canal. FETAL STATION. Fetal station refers to where the presenting part is in your pelvis. The presenting part. The presenting part is the part of the baby that leads the way through the birth canal. Most often, it is the baby's head, but it can be a shoulder, the buttocks, or the feet.

Related to fetal position: fetal presentation. the relationship of the part of the fetus that presents in the pelvis to the four quadrants of the maternal pelvis, identified by initial L (left), R (right), A (anterior), and P (posterior). The presenting part is also identified by initial O (occiput), M (mentum), and S (sacrum). If a fetus presents with the occiput directed to the posterior aspect of the mother's right side, the fetal position is right occiput posterior (ROP). Compare fetal attitude, fetal presentation.
Fetal position reflects the orientation of the fetal head or butt within the birth canal. This will close as the baby grows during the 1st year of life, but at birth, it is open. The anterior fontanel is an obstetrical landmark because of its' distinctive diamond shape.
The bones of the fetal scalp are soft and meet at suture lines.. Over the forehead, where the bones meet, is a gap, called the anterior fontanel, or soft spot.. This will close as the baby grows during the 1st year of life, but at birth, it is open.
The terms used for breech positions are the same as for cephalic positions, except the sacrum of the fetus is used as the identifying landmark, instead of the occiput. Sacrum Anterior (SA) means the fetal sacrum is closest to the mother's symphysis.
fetal maternal rotation. alteration of the longitudinal relationship of the fetus to the dam effected per vaginam by manipulation with the hand or an obstetric crutch, or externally by casting the dam and rolling her from side to side while the fetus is held in position via a hand in the vagina.
The fetal attitude describes the position of the parts of your baby's body. The normal fetal attitude is commonly called the fetal position. 1  The head is tucked down to the chest.  The arms and legs are drawn in towards the center of the chest.
The goal is to find the easiest way out. Certain body positions give the baby a smaller shape, which makes it easier for your baby to get through this tight passage. The best position for the baby to pass through the pelvis is with the head down and the body facing toward the mother's back.
_____ is the reduction of pore space in sediment as a result of the weight of the overlying sediments a _____ is a wave-resistant structure that is built from marine invertebrates A turbulent gravity driven flow consisting of water and sediment is known as _____ current
a biogenic sediment that forms from the accumulation of planyt debris is known as _____ name a category of sedimentary rocks formed by the precipitation of minerals dissolved in a lake, river, or seawater?
1 Deposition - Sediment is deposited when the energy of the transporting medium becomes too low to continue the transport process. In other words, if the velocity of the transporting medium becomes too low to transport sediment, the sediment will fall out and become deposited.
the bonneville salt flats in utah are primarily composed of _____- sediments _____ is the reduction of pore space in a rock due to the weight of the overlying sediment Recent Class Questions
Examples. 1  Beach deposits and wind blown deposits generally show good sorting because the energy of the transporting medium is usually constant. 2  Stream deposits are usually poorly sorted because the energy (velocity) in a stream varies with position in the stream and time.
SCIN 138 SCIN138 Final Exam 4 Answers (American Public University) 1  The group of processes that transform sediments into rock is known as 2  _____. _____ is the reduction of pore space in a rock due to the weight of the overlying sediment. 3  Flowing regolith that is not saturated with water is known as a _______ flow.
The distance the sediment is transported and the energy of the transporting medium all leave clues in the final sediment that tell us something about the mode of transportation. Deposition - Sediment is deposited when the energy of the transporting medium becomes too low to continue the transport process.
The formation of a clastic sediment and sedimentary rocks involves five processes: 1  Weathering - The first step is transforming solid rock into smaller fragments or dissolved ions by physical and chemical weathering as discussed in the last lecture. 2  Erosion - Erosion is actually many process which act together to lower the surface of the earth.
The processes by which the sediment becomes lithified into a hard sedimentary rock is called diagenesis and includes all physical, chemical and biological processes that act on the sediment. The first step in diagenesis is the compaction of the sediment and loss of water as a result of the weight of the overlying sediment. Compaction and burial may cause recrystallization of the minerals to make the rock even harder.
The final sediment thus reflects the energy of the transporting medium. Lithification (Diagenesis) - Lithification is the process that turns sediment into rock. The first stage of the process is compaction. Compaction occurs as the weight of the overlying material increases. Compaction forces the grains closer together, reducing pore space and eliminating some of the contained water. Some of this water may carry mineral components in solution, and these constituents may later precipitate as new minerals in the pore spaces.
The most common causes are fatigue, stress, and eye problems. Nutritional deficiencies or too much of certain substances, such as caffeine and alcohol, can also trigger twitching. Less common but more serious causes of an eyebrow twitch include dehydration, diabetes, and anemia, among other disorders.
Other symptoms include sensitivity to light, sensation of being overwhelmed by complex patterns, or eye pain. Hormonal changes, medications, chemicals in foods and even flashing lights can cause migraines. The migraine episode may only last a few minutes, but typically lasts about 20 to 30 minutes.
Medications, either eye drops or oral, are a common cause of a harmless change in pupil size. More serious causes of unequal pupil size may be due to aneurysm, bleeding inside the skull, brain tumor, excess pressure on an eye due to glaucoma, meningitis, encephalitis, migraines, or seizures.
1 Symptoms may include twitching of the eyelids, forced closure of the eye, spasms of the lower face, and the pulling of the mouth to one side.  Trigeminal neuralgia (TGN) is a condition causing shocks of extreme pain in the lips, eyes, nose, scalp, forehead, and jaw, lasting up to two minutes.
General problems in the eyes can also trigger eyebrow twitching. Dry eyes and eye strain can both cause the eyebrow to twitch. Dry eyes may be caused by age, overuse of the eye, or certain medications. Eye strain is also caused by overuse of the eyes, but it can also be caused by vision problems. Eye strain and dry eyes are very treatable, so talk to an eye doctor about symptoms for relief. Nutritional imbalances may also lead to eyebrow twitching.
Symptoms include a severe loss of vision either suddenly or over many days, or visual field deficiencies. At the time of vision loss there will be swelling inside the eye which can be detected by an eye care professional. The condition often occurs in the middle-aged or elderly.
Eyelid and Facial spasm. Eyelid spasms are small muscle spasms that may occur in the upper or lower eyelid. Typically, these twitches are harmless spasms in the muscles around the eye. They can be felt by the patient and sometimes seen by others.
Some medical problems are thought to be the cause of eyebrow twitching. Dehydration, hypothyroidism, and lupus have been linked to eyebrow spasms. The flu, some nerve disorders, and food poisoning may also trigger this condition. These causes are significantly less common than stress or fatigue, but they do occur.
Depending on which part of the nervous system is affected, symptoms could include headache, dizziness, memory loss, numbness, pain, vision problems, and difficulty walking. Mount Sinai’s NeuroAIDS Program specializes in diagnosing and treating the full range of HIV-related neurological disorders.
Binocular diplopia occurs when there is misalignment of the eyes. Examples of binocular diplopia include esotropia (crossing of the eyes) or exotropia (one eye “wanders” away to the side). Symptoms of diplopia include seeing a single object as two images.
Updated June 30, 2016. Gastroschisis is a birth defect in which an infant is born with some or all of his/her intestines on the outside of the abdomen due to an abnormal opening in the abdominal muscle. The opening can range from small to large, and in some cases other organs can also protrude through the hole. Young mothers who use recreational drugs early in pregnancy or who smoke have a higher risk of having an infant born with gastroschisis, but in many cases, it is not known what causes the disorder.
Infants suspected of having pyloric stenosis usually undergo blood tests because the continuous vomiting of stomach acid, as well as the resulting dehydration from fluid losses, can cause salt and other imbalances in the blood that need to be corrected.
This article is about birth in humans. For birth in other mammals, see birth. Childbirth, also known as labour and delivery, is the ending of a pregnancy by one or more babies leaving a woman's uterus. In 2015 there were about 135 million births globally. About 15 million were born before 37 weeks of gestation, while between 3 and 12% were born after 42 weeks.
Story on growing number of gastroschisis cases - a birth defect in which babies are born with their intestines outside their bodies.. Rare Diseases. Gastroschisis is a birth defect in which an infant is born with some or all of his/her intestines on the outside of the abdomen due to an abnormal opening in the abdominal muscle.
Pyloric stenosis, a condition that may affect the gastrointestinal tract during infancy, isn't normal — it can cause your baby to vomit forcefully and often and may cause other problems such as dehydration and salt and fluid imbalances. Immediate treatment for pyloric stenosis is extremely important.
Abdominal wall surgery. Abdominal wall surgery is a procedure that improves the appearance of flabby, stretched-out abdominal (belly) muscles and skin. It is often called a tummy tuck. It can range from a simple mini-tummy tuck to more extensive surgery. Abdominal wall surgery is not the same as liposuction, which is another way to remove fat. But abdominal wall surgery is sometimes combined with liposuction.
In brief: Birth anatomy. Your question needs slightly more info. There is a term called malrotation and deals with abnormal rotation of the blood vessels an the small intestine and colon. Another possibility is if there is a defect of the diaphragm that allow the stomach to come through and twist. Ultimately it is usually an abnormal rotation of the intestines and blood supply. Can't be prevented or foreseen.
Any dehydration or electrolyte problems in the blood will be corrected with intravenous (IV) fluids, usually within 24 hours. A surgical procedure called pyloromyotomy, which involves cutting through the thickened muscles of the pylorus, is performed to relieve the blockage that results from pyloric stenosis. The pylorus is examined through a very small incision, and the muscles that are overgrown and thickened are spread and relaxed.
a temporary organ that forms within the uterus to allow the exchange of nutrients, oxygen, and waste between the mother and the fetus without allowing maternal and fetal blood to mix.
A labour ward, also called a delivery ward or labour and delivery, is generally a department of a hospital that focuses on providing health care to women and their children during childbirth. It is generally closely linked to the hospital's neonatal intensive care unit and/or obstetric surgery unit if present.

1 Your doctor or pharmacist will usually tell you how many Zantac tablets to take and how often to take them. 2  You will also find this information on the label of your medicine. 3  The normal adult dosage is 150 to 300 milligrams per day, taken as one 150 mg tablet once or twice a day, or one 300 mg tablet at bedtime.
Zantac (ranitidine) belongs to a group of drugs called histamine-2 blockers. Zantac works by reducing the amount of acid your stomach produces. Zantac is used to treat and prevent ulcers in the stomach and intestines.
Do not take over-the-counter ranitidine for longer than 2 weeks unless your doctor tells you to. If symptoms of heartburn, acid indigestion, or sour stomach last longer than 2 weeks, stop taking ranitidine and call your doctor.
Ranitidine comes as a tablet, an effervescent tablet, effervescent granules, and a syrup to take by mouth. It is usually taken once a day at bedtime or two to four times a day. Over-the-counter ranitidine comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken once or twice a day.
Zantac (ranitidine) belongs to a group of drugs called histamine-2 blockers. Zantac works by reducing the amount of acid your stomach produces.
For the treatment of stomach ulcers or duodenal ulcers in children or babies, the recommended Zantac dosage is usually 2 mg to 4 mg per kg (a little less than 1 mg to 2 mg per pound) twice daily.
For treating GERD or erosive esophagitis in children or babies, the ranitidine dose is 5 mg to 10 mg per kg (a little less than 2.5 mg to 5 mg per pound) total per day. This is usually split up into two doses per day. (Click Zantac for Babies for more information on using ranitidine in young children.).
Ranitidine is used to treat ulcers; gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), a condition in which backward flow of acid from the stomach causes heartburn and injury of the food pipe (esophagus); and conditions where the stomach produces too much acid, such as Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.
Ranitidine Dosing for Ulcers. For the treatment of stomach ulcers or duodenal ulcers in children or babies, the ranitidine dose is 2 mg to 4 mg per kg (a little less than 1 mg to 2 mg per pound) twice daily. The total amount per day should not exceed 300 mg (this is only an issue with larger children).
Zantac Dosing for Ulcers. For the treatment of stomach ulcers or duodenal ulcers in children or babies, the recommended Zantac dosage is usually 2 mg to 4 mg per kg (a little less than 1 mg to 2 mg per pound) twice daily.

• Gift giving — accepting from or giving to a particular client. The supervisor should explore the meaning of the gift and perception of changed relationship. • Boundary problems in home — Family-based services can create ambiguous situations, and the supervisor needs to explore potentially changed relationships.
These examples were actual supervisory situations presented in a supervision workshop. Supervisor-employee relationships can potentially be ethical quagmires. Supervisors must be cognizant not only of their employees’ ethical decisions but also of their own ethical behavior.
Yet, there are times when these guidelines and standards differ with agency policy or norm, resulting in an ethical dilemma for the supervisor. Today’s complex practice settings cause increasing ethical conflicts. Ethical dangers in supervision can occur in both the administrative and clinical aspects of practice.
A certified copy is a copy (often a photocopy) of a primary document, that has on it an endorsement or certificate that it is a true copy of the primary document. It does not certify that the primary document is genuine, only that it is a true copy of the primary document. A certified copy is often used in English-speaking common law countries as a convenient way of providing a copy of documents.
One of the supervisor’s tasks is to provide professional socialization, to not only cultivate skills but also instill professional conscience. Certainly, modeling professional behavior is one way of teaching it. An ethical concern arises when there is uncertainty or conflict about values.
You can change your first name to your middle name and then choose the name you want. That way you aren’t losing the name they gave, you’re just adding another one. Also if they still call you by your current name, you can tell people it’s your middle name and you only your family uses it.
1 I certify that this is a true and correct copy of a document in the possession of A.B. (NH). 2  On this DD day of MONTH, YYYY I certify that the ______ document is a true, exact, complete and unaltered copy of the original.
For example, a birth certificate in Russian is to be used in an English-speaking country. Typically, the document must be translated professionally and have the professional's certificate of accuracy attached to the translation together with a copy of the primary document.
I found a way around that. Make your current name your middle name and then you can pick whatever you want as your first name. When people ask you just say “oh that’s my middle name but I don’t use it anymore”. and I agree with the strangers not caring about pronouncing it! The same thing happens to me.
Both supervisors and supervisees can learn from this comprehensive review of social work supervision issues. Maintaining professional ethics in the supervisory process can pose unique challenges. The same ethical violations that can occur in a therapeutic relationship can be paralleled in a supervisory relationship.

Fire Intensity. Fire intensity is influenced by environmental conditions, such as fuel load (amount of leaf and grass litter), litter moisture, litter size, air temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed, as well as the firing technique used.
Fire Intensity and Severity. Fire severity is a measure of the physical change in an area caused by burning (Sousa 1984). Although fire intensity is a key component of burn severity, these are two distinct features of fire; the terms are often incorrectly interchanged. Used correctly, fire intensity refers to the rate at which a fire produces heat at the flaming front and should be expressed in terms of temperature or heat yield. Fire severity, on the other hand, describes the immediate effects of fire on vegetation, litter, or soils.
Fire intensity table. Fire intensity, expressed in kilowatts per metre (kW/m), is the amount of energy released from each metre of headfire edge. One kW/m is equivalent to the energy released by a small bar radiator. Fire intensity depends upon how much fuel is burnt and how fast it burns.
It is a. function of the duration of the fire, and relates closely to the amount of surface. fuel, litter and duff consumption, and their moisture content. Ground char is a. qualitative measure of a fire’s heat pulse downward into the soil. It is.
Fire intensity. The most important measure of fire behaviour is fire intensity. Fire intensity (I) represents the heat released per meter of fire front (kW/m of fire front). It is a function of (1) heat yield of fuel (kilojoules/kg), (2) amount of fuel per unit area (kg/m2) and (3) the rate of forward spread of fire front (km/h).
Byram (1959) defined the term as the rate of energy or heat release per unit time, per unit length of fire front, regardless of its depth. However, to avoid confusion with related terms, we suggest the specific term fireline intensity when referring to Byrams definition.
The rate of energy or heat release per unit length of fire front, regardless of its depth (Byram 1959). Fireline intensity is synonymous with the terms Byram's fire intensity (Byram 1959) and frontal fire intensity. It is the numerical product of a fire's rate of spread, fuel consumption, and heat yield at a given point on a fires perimeter. Reaction intensity and total fire flux are examples of other measures of fire intensity. Units.
In addition, more fuel means larger flames and greater fire intensity. Fire behaviour is affected by the moisture content of fuels, which in turn depends on a number of factors such as weather conditions, vegetation types and whether the fuel is dead or living.
Effects of Timing of Fire and Fire Intensity. Fire frequency (or fire-return interval) is the most important factor with regard to how prescribed fire influences vegetation composition and structure. Fire intensity and season of fire are two other factors that can also influence plant communities and thus wildlife communities.
Fire intensity. n. The amount of energy or heat release per unit time. FireWords uses a non-specific definition of fire intensity that encompasses several specific types of fire intensity measures.
Law Enforcement Accreditation. While not a type of law enforcement agency, one designation to look for when evaluating departments is CALEA Accreditation. CALEA, which stands for the Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies, is the international authority on law enforcement standards.
There are more than 17,000 state and local law enforcement agencies in the United States, ranging in size from one officer to more than 30,000.
Chief of Police. With an authorized strength of over 2000 sworn officers, the Atlanta Police Department is the largest law enforcement agency in the State of Georgia.
A full-service police agency, the Department has adopted a community oriented philosophy and relies heavily upon community input and collaborative problem-solving strategies.
California Law Enforcement Agencies. The agencies below are POST participating agencies and departments unless otherwise noted. See also: Federal and International Law Enforcement Agencies, and Special Interest Associations. The Commission on POST is not responsible for the content or security of these external websites.
Citizen Advisory Councils and Neighborhood Planning Units representing 139 separate neighborhoods promote citizen input for Departmental decisions while mini-precincts, foot patrols and bicycle patrols encourage personalized policing and frequent citizen-officer interaction.
Types of Law Enforcement Agencies. There are many different types of law enforcement agencies, from small town police departments to large federal agencies. The types of jobs available will depend on the type of agency, its mission, size, and jurisdiction.
Many of these are municipal police departments operated by local governments, but there are actually several types of law enforcement agencies. 1  Local Police includes municipal, county, tribal, and regional police that derive authority from the local governing body that created it.
Emergency police response is available around the clock and is facilitated by strategically located police precincts throughout the City and at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport.
Cities have majors, and in most cities, the major is the head of the local police. Another View: There is NO SUCH title as the Mayor of Law Enforcement!. You are mixing your … titles and/or understanding of the political and administrative makeup of municipalities and their police departments.

Too much fat keeps bark from forming on your meat, but no fat will leave a tasteless bark. You want to leave a nice, thin layer of fat. This thin layer will render during the smoking process and give that bark an excellent flavor. Step #3: Smoke-Don't Steam!
I think you will find that most bark will produce more smoke (and more pungent smoke) than just plain wood does. The key for me on whether thats a problem or not depends largely on three things, the length of the cook, the type of meat and the heat of the fire its going on.

I love my brisket to have a bark,burnt ends are like brisket candy to me but I have read that it is not possible to get a bark in an electric smoker. I have watch the Smokin Tex brisket video and did not see a bark or smoke ring but have seen pictures on this forum of brisket that appear to have a nice bark.
1 Place coals on foil. 2  Peel pineapple bark in thin strips from fruit, roughly chop, and then combine chopped bark with sugar, salt and sage. 3  Layer on top of coals in dish. 4  To smoke chicken, place chicken pieces on BBQ resting rack and close lid for 15 minutes.
Bark needs some moisture to form because the water soluble spices must be dissolved, but the moisture found naturally in the meat and smoke is generally enough. Do not overdo the basting of the meat or you will actually prevent bark forming. Sugar: Sugar is the last step in the formation of bark.
Ok, so I'm a little confused on the whole bark debate, seems to me that there are some woods where bark is ok to leave on and some not.
For Pineapple Bark Smoke: 1  Heat BBQ coals until white-hot. 2  Line a small metal dish with three layers of aluminium foil. 3  Peel pineapple bark in thin strips from fruit, roughly chop, and then combine chopped bark with sugar, salt and sage. 4  Layer on top of coals in dish.
The protecto plate was a factory identification card that was supplied through the dealer to the lucky recipient of a brand new 1967 Chevelle. It came in the back of the booklet shown above and carried coded information about the factory installed equipment / options for that particular vehicle, and this is why they are so talked about now.... it is proof of how the car was originally delivered.
Your Protecto-Plate An important source of information. The Protect-O-Plate was furnished with all Camaros and was a metal plate imprinted at the assembly plant. The plate contained information on various standard or optional equipment. You may determine from the imprinted information on the plate the type of engine, transmission, rear axle, exterior color, the month the vehicle was produced, and other basic vehicle information.
For ’67, Pontiac revised the Protect-O-Plate program. To eliminate the delays in preparing the plates at the Pontiac home plant and mailing them to customers’ homes, every new Pontiac shipped with the vehicle plate portion of the Protect-O-Plate already filled out and the owner plate portion of the Protect-O-Plate left blank.
There is really nothing mystical about protecto-plates, except perhaps what happened to the one you wanted. They decode through a series of numbers that refer to various production components. This is a copy of a protecto plate 'imprint', the actual plate is metal with a wavy edge.. I did not use the original as all the letters and codes are 'reversed' and would be impossible to read. Here is how the numbers work out. This letter indicates the colour of interior. This is the body colour, lower first, then upper.

If you dispose of this vehicle, please leave this book in the glovebox. The new owner must submit the owner “name” plate of the original owner and last page in this book to receive a new owner plate.”. The Ident-O-Plate program continued through the ’64 model year.
In 1965, General Motors introduced the Protect-O-Plate to all of its brands, based upon the success of the Ident-O-Plate. It served the same purpose for warranty and service claims, though some data fields were relocated on the vehicle plate. The Protect-O-Plate program continued without any changes for the ’66 model year.
The History Of The Pontiac Ident-O-Plate And Protect-O-Plate Programs (1963-1972) Authors note: The idea for this feature story came from Jim Taylor of Jim Taylor Engine Service in Phillipsburg, New Jersey.
As the Retail Delivery Card for each owner is received at Pontiac, a plate containing the owner’s name, address, delivery date, and vehicle identification number, corresponding with the number on the vehicle plate, is made and sent direct to the owner’s home.

The leading cause of a wheel bearing failing is its seal. The inside of a bearing can be a hot place. When a bearing is cooling off, the contracting metal, air and lubricant can create a vacuum that is hopefully held by the seals.
When the seal on the wheel bearing is broken or damaged, the noise starts out very faint and becomes louder over time. It sounds like the noise that your tires make when hitting a rumble strip on the highway, just not quite as loud, something like the sound of playing cards flapping against bicycle spokes.
If you just want to check your wheel bearings for wear without removing the wheels, do the following: 1  Jack up your vehicle. Support it on jack stands. 2  Without getting under the vehicle, grasp each wheel at the top and bottom and attempt to rock it. There should be minimal movement.
So I drive a ****box 89 Sunbird. The RF wheel bearing has been going bad over the past few months, but I don't know exactly when to pull the plug and say it's not safe to drive it anymore. All it's done is make a humming noise at speeds >40mph. There doesn't seem to be any play in the tire, and the car doesn't shake or pull (much).
You can check your car’s wheel bearings to see if they need to be repacked. Wheel bearings usually come in pairs of inner and outer bearings. They allow your wheels to turn freely over thousands of miles by cushioning the contact between the wheel and the spindle it sits on with frictionless bearings and lots of nice, gooey grease.
Holy ****, replacing a wheel bearing is one of the simplest and cheapest things you can do. Here's what'll happen if you don't... it'll overheat so bad that it will weld itself to the spindle. You'll know this when you're tooling along and it starts making a screaming noise and you smell and see smoke.
The car is making a roaring sound while driving and when you turn the wheel to the right, the sound gets loader. There also a bit of a vibration in the gas pedal. We changed the driver side wheel bearing and there is no change. We also over inflated the tires to see if the noise was the tires and there was no change.
If you just want to check your wheel bearings for wear without removing the wheels, do the following: Jack up your vehicle. Support it on jack stands. Without getting under the vehicle, grasp each wheel at the top and bottom and attempt to rock it.
On a car, a wheel bearing rides on a metal axle shaft and fits tightly inside the hub, which is a hollow chunk of metal at the center of the wheel. The hub holds the lug bolts that you use to bolt the tire onto the wheel. The wheel bearing is pressed into the hub from the back.
Most serviceable wheel bearings need maintenance every 25,000 to 30,000 miles, or during every brake service. But, the average life of a sealed wheel bearing and hub assembly is about 85,000 to 100,000 miles, without the opportunity for you to repack the bearings.
1) Your facial hair has to be clean and dry before applying Just For Men. Facial hair can absorb skin oil and perspiration which can cause uneven shading and premature fading. Wash it with baby shampoo and dry thoroughly (use a hair dryer if needed).
LOW BLENDED FADE HAIRCUT. The low blended fade haircut is usually faded a little lower on the sides and the back of the head. The haircut is faded about an inch above the ears to keep the blend low on the sides of the head. The higher the blend is started, the higher the blend will be on the sides of the head.
A fade haircut. Conversely, a fade will usually taper the hair starting at the top of the pate and ending just above or right at the ear and at the occipital bone with no line. The same cutting concept is applied but it can only be done with hair clippers in order to fade out hair smoothly.

Facial hair is a secondary sex characteristic of human males. Men typically start developing facial hair in the later years of puberty or adolescence, between seventeen and twenty years of age, and most do not finish developing a full adult beard until their early twenties or later.
Tapered, tight and never out of style, the Fade Cut is easy to do and easier to maintain. The hair at the sides and back is cut close with clippers, and the hair “fades” to the top, which is usually kept short.

It can be done with both hair clipper and scissor (with the help of a comb using the scissors-over-comb method). It allows men to sport longer lengths while still maintaining a carefully groomed appearance. This cut also allows for more movement and greater styling flexibility. A fade haircut.
Colton Haynes tapered haircut. With a taper, the length of the hair gradually decreases from the top of the pate down to the nape of the neck and to the sides. It can be done with both hair clipper and scissor (with the help of a comb using the scissors-over-comb method).
FOV stands for Field-of-View and it is the width of the image as seen through optics. This is often quoted as width at distance or in degrees. For example, 300ft@1000yrds would mean when the optics are focused at an object 1000 yards away, the width of the entire image as seen through the optics is 300 feet wide.
You simply divide the magnification of the binocular into the diameter of the objective lens or bottom lens of the binocular or spotting scope. So, a 7x35 binocular has an exit pupil diameter of 5 mm (35 divided by 7). A 10x50 binocular also has an exit pupil of 5 mm (50 divided by 10).
What Do the Numbers Mean on Binoculars? When shopping for a pair of binoculars, it's easy to get focused on the highest magnification. However, higher magnifications decrease your field of view. This is why it is important to understand the numbers on binoculars in order to find the right pair for you. The first number you see represents the magnification. If a pair of binoculars is 10x25, then 10 is the magnification. It's easy to assume that 10x25 means that 10 is multiplied by 25.
All binoculars are described by using a pair of numbers, such as 7×50 or 8×30. The first number, including the x, represents magnification or “power”. This tells the degree to which the object observed is enlarged. For example, a 7x binocular makes an object appear seven times closer than when viewed by the naked eye.
All binoculars will have two numbers to designate them, such as 10x50. This means a binocular with 10 times magnification and 50mm objective lenses (the big ones!). Common sizes are 8x42, 10x50, 20x60, 15x70, etc. Optical glass is generally BAK4 or BAK7 standard, BAK4 is denser and gives superior vision.
The second number refers to the objective lens diameter in millimeters. In the 10x25 example, 25 is the size of the objective lens. The objective lens is the lens that is pointed toward the subject. It gathers light to make the images brighter. The size of the objective lens determines the size of the binoculars.
If you divide the objective lens diameter by the magnification, you will get a number approximately between 4 and 8. This number is called the exit pupil, and represents the diameter of the beam of light that leaves the eyepiece when you hold a binocular with the objective pointed towards a light source.
What do the NUMBERS mean on binoculars and spotting scopes? This is the most common question about binoculars and it is a good one. You will see combinations of numbers like 7x35, 8x42, 10x50 or 7-15x35 and many more. The numbers to the left of the x always refer to how much magnification the binocular has. The number to the right of the x indicate how big the lens is at the bottom of the binocular (this is called the objective lens). So, 7x35 means this binocular magnifies objects so they appear 7 times closer.
Porro type binoculars have an angled light path and are the traditional looking binoculars. Roof prism binoculars have a straight barrel design and do not angle the light path. Contrary to what you may think, the roof prism type of binoculars typically cost more to produce than porros.

Kalasha, also spelled as Kalash and kalasa (Sanskrit: कलश; kalaśa, literally “pitcher, pot”), is a metal (brass, copper, silver or gold) pot with a large base and small mouth, large enough to hold a coconut. Sometimes “Kalasha” also refers to such a pot filled with water and topped with a coronet of mango leaves and a coconut.
Remove sediments eg, residues of WP pesticides, from spray tanks before adding KALASH 510 SL. Avoid the use of hard or muddy water, or water with a high colloidal content derived from soils high in. organic matter.
The Purna-Kalasha is worshipped in all Hindu festivities related to marriage and childbirth, as a mother goddess or Devi. In this context, the metal pot or Kalasha represents material things: a container of fertility – the earth and the womb, which nurtures and nourishes life. The mango leaves associated with Kama, the god of love, symbolize the pleasure aspect of fertility.

First, there are three ways in which you can keep chickens: 1  Free range Advantages: It's fun and you get to see the chickens run all around. 2  Limited range You can make up a fence (see fence section below) which will contain them. 3  Completely housed (in a coop) Advantages: Safety.
Lisa Steele • March 1, 2017. One of the most common questions I get asked on my Facebook page (Fresh Eggs Daily) is how wide chicken roosting bars should be and how high off the ground they should be positioned. So here’s everything you need to know about chicken roosting bars.
Free range Advantages: It's fun and you get to see the chickens run all around. They also eat healthy stuff (and bugs) in the yard. Disadvantages: The mess (droppings plus scratched up plants/grass/yard) is not contained, and the droppings can end up in places like your driveway.
How to Build Chicken Perches. Chicken perches provide a place for your chickens to roost. They may spend some time on the perches in the day, but should all be there at night. Providing a safe night time perching or roosting area will ensure that your chickens will want to come home to roost each night.
Also, feeders and waterers (if you leave them in the coop overnight) should not be placed under the roosts, nor should the nesting boxes. Learn more about composting chicken manure. Width – Chicken roosting bars should be at least 2 inches wide and preferably 4 inches wide. Chickens don’t wrap their feet around a perch like wild birds do. They actually prefer to sleep flat-footed.
First, there are three ways in which you can keep chickens: 1  Free range Advantages: It's fun and you get to see the chickens run all around. They also eat healthy stuff (and bugs) in the yard. 2  Limited range You can make up a fence (see fence section below) which will contain them.
Eggs laid in those nesting boxes will be filthy. When chickens sleep on a roost, their manure drops down into the bedding and the hens don’t breathe in moisture and ammonia fumes all night. This is why roosts should be up high and why coops built like dog houses are a bad idea.
A roost is an elevated bar, branch or narrow plank on which chickens perch to sleep. Seeking high spots to spend the night has been part of chicken survival instincts since long before its domestication over 5000 years ago. Chickens aren’t all that fast, they lack the prowess to ward off many predators and they are sound sleepers.
Chicken Perches can be made from 2x2's, broom handles, dowel rods and natural tree limbs. Try to keep the diameter at about 2 inches for larger chickens and 1 inch for bantam size chickens. Round off any sharp edges and sand rough spots. Some people in colder climates will use 2x4's mounted with the wide side up.
The dowels should be about 1 1/2 inches in diameter. Plan on at least six inches of roost per bird. In the winter they’ll huddle up for warmth, in the summer they won’t crowd so tightly together. Hens are fussy about who they sleep next to, so plenty of space will prevent squabbles.

As the name suggests, volcanic mountains are formed by volcanoes. Volcanic Mountains are formed when molten rock (magma) deep within the earth, erupts, and piles upon the surface. Magna is called lava when it breaks through the earth's crust. When the ash and lava cools, it builds a cone of rock.
Fault blocks are causes by stresses in the Earth's crust. Examples of fault block mountains are the Vosges Mountains and the Black Forest Mountains. Fault blocks are causes by stresses in the Earth's crust. Examples of fault block mountains are the Vosges Mountains and the Black Forest Mountains.
Fault-block Mountains. These mountains form when faults or cracks in the earth's crust force some materials or blocks of rock up and others down. Instead of the earth folding over, the earth's crust fractures (pulls apart). It breaks up into blocks or chunks.

Fault-block Mountains These mountains form when faults or cracks in the earth's crust force some materials or blocks of rock up and others down. Instead of the earth folding over, the earth's crust fractures (pulls apart). It breaks up into blocks or chunks. Sometimes these blocks of rock move up and down, as they move apart and blocks of rock end up being stacked on one another. Often fault-block mountains have a steep front side and a sloping back side. Examples of fault-block mountains include: the Sierra Nevada mountains in North America; the Harz Mountains in Germany ; Dome Mountains. Dome mountains are the result of a great amount of melted rock (magma) pushing its way up under the earth crust.
Sierra Nevada, Vosages of Europe,Black Forest in Germany, Death Valley in California are some examples of fault-block mountains.
What different types of Mountains are there? There are five basic kinds of mountains: Fold Mountains (Folded Mountains) Fault-block Mountains (Block Mountains) Dome Mountains; Volcanic Mountains; Plateau Mountains; These different types of mountain names not only distinguish the physical characteristics of the mountains, but also how they were formed. Fold Mountains . Fold mountains are the most common type of mountain. The world’s largest mountain ranges are fold mountains. These ranges were formed over millions of years. Fold mountains are formed when two plates collide head on, and their edges crumbled, much the same way as a piece of paper folds when pushed together.

Think of your liver like your own personal filtering system: Suck in the bad and spit out the good. The liver has many important functions that keeps a person healthy. It removes harmful material from the bloodstream and helps digest food, says holistic nutritionist Hermeet Suri from Mississauga, Ont.
Antioxidants help protect your liver, promote recovery if it's damaged and even inhibit cancer cells. Eat a variety of colorful fruits and vegetables, which tend to provide the most antioxidants. Rich examples include sweet potatoes, mangoes, carrots, berries, spinach, kale, tomatoes, apricots, watermelon and oranges.
This is about detoxing the body’s largest gland, the liver. It has a number of functions including, but not limited to: Detoxifying the blood to rid it of harmful substances (like toxins, drugs, alcohol, and more) Storing vitamins and iron.
Think of your liver as an air filter. All the toxins we eat, drink and breathe in get clogged up in this hard-working organ. Even though our body has it's own natural detoxification system, there is a lot we can do to give it a helping hand, largely by eating the right kinds of foods.
Detox Your Liver With These 19 Super Foods. 1. Beets and Carrots: Carrots are rich in Glutathione, a protein that helps detoxify the liver. Both are extremely high in plant-flavonoids and beta-carotene. Eating beets and carrots can help stimulate and improve overall liver function.
In addition to being great for the liver, asparagus is a great vegetable to eat raw when you're feeling bloated. Asparagus is a natural diuretic. There are plenty of ways to detox your body without dieting. My advice is to incorporate moderate, but regular amounts of these foods in your diet on a regular basis. Along with plenty of fresh water, your liver will be loving you in no time. Check out my Facebook page for a great liver detoxing tea I just posted.
Healthy fats are important to any diet, plant-based or not, but too much is never a good thing when it comes to fats. Your liver needs fat for proper function, but too much can cause problems with bile production, which will affect the digestion of fats and possibly other issues of digestion.
How Food Fits Into the Equation. As you can see, your liver health is nothing to play around with, so feeding it and your body beneficial foods only makes good sense. One of the best things you can do for your liver is to eat a healthy, plant-based diet. Health experts recommended eliminating or reducing animal foods to care for your liver, just as much as they do eliminating alcohol, refined sugar, excess caffeine, and processed foods.
Whether you have liver disease from drinking too much alcohol, from a virus or from other factors, a healthy diet could help minimize your symptoms, guard against complications and strengthen your overall wellness through treatment and recovery.
Dietary shifts that support liver health include limiting protein, which helps limit the buildup of toxic waste, and increasing your carbohydrate intake for energy and to compensate for eating less protein. Although carbohydrates should be your dietary mainstay, moderate fat intake is also important for wellness.
Hives can appear on any area of the body; they may change shape, move around, disappear and reappear over short periods of time. The bumps - red or skin-colored “wheals” with clear edges - usually appear suddenly and go away just as quickly.
Prickly heat rash, also called miliaria, is a rash that can develop after a person sweats far more than usual and sweat glands become blocked. Babies and children can also get prickly heat rash during hot or humid weather because their sweat glands are not fully developed.
As well as taking steps to avoid getting heat rash in the first place, there are plenty of home remedies that have been used for generations to help ease the pain and discomfort caused by the rash. Take a look at these simple 11 remedies that could soothe your skin. 1. Oatmeal bath.
Heat rash — also known as prickly heat and miliaria — isn't just for babies. Heat rash affects adults, too, especially during hot, humid weather. Heat rash develops when blocked pores (sweat ducts) trap perspiration under your skin. Symptoms range from superficial blisters to deep, red lumps. Some forms of heat rash feel prickly or intensely itchy.
Small, itchy red bumps on the skin are the symptoms of heat rash. The rash may feel prickly, stinging or burning. Seek medical advice if: Heat rash does not go away on its own within a few days. You develop an infection in an area where you recently had heat rash.
To help prevent heat rash, avoid situations that can lead to excessive sweating, such as hot, humid environments. Avoid strenuous exercise when it is very warm. In hot weather, use air conditioning, fans, and cool showers and baths to stay cool; dry your skin thoroughly; and wear lightweight, loose-fitting clothes.
What Are the Treatments for Heat Rash? In most cases, heat rash will clear up on its own in a few days if the affected area is kept cool and dry. So cool your body in an air-conditioned room or with a fan, or take a cool shower or bath and let your skin air dry.
Comment from: 25-34 Female (Patient) Published: March 31. I get heat rash under my watch whether I'm wearing it or not. I also get it around my bra line, on my sides, stomach, and under my waste. It's also common for me to see it on my hands. I break out in hives, and in severe cases, the hives look like welts or blisters.
Hives, also known as urticaria, affects about 20 percent of people at some time during their lives. It can be triggered by many substances or situations and usually starts as an itchy patch of skin that turns into swollen red welts. The itching may be mild to severe.
I am a Chef, developed a severe heat rash, under my breast, by the bra line, lower stomach and the groin area. The heat rash was so bad, my skin looked like I was burned, and taking a shower was very painful. I have never had anything like this before.
1937 -- Asteroid Hermes -- about a kilometer in diameter -- misses Earth by 600,000 miles. Hermes, although smaller than the 'roid that snuffed the dinosaurs, could have been a true category killer, able to cause epic devastation and kill millions.
Ever since the Earth formed 4.5 billion years ago, it has been bombarded with rocks from space. Each year about 50,000 tons of asteroidal material enters the Earths atmosphere.
An asteroid impact is also the stuff of science fact. There are obvious craters on Earth (and the moon) that show us a long history of large objects hitting the planet. The most famous asteroid ever is the one that hit Earth 65 million years ago. It's thought that this asteroid threw so much moisture and dust in to the atmosphere that it cut off sunlight, lowering temperatures worldwide and causing the extinction of the dinosaurs.
The key to this trick is time. The Earth is 8,000 miles across, so at most you have to move the asteroid 4,000 miles to make it miss. If you have, say, two years of advance warning you need only change the velocity of the rock by one-fifth of a mile per hour to make it miss. That’s far less than walking speed!
Here's a typical example. In 2028, the asteroid 1997XF11 will come extremely close to Earth but will miss the planet. If something were to change and it did hit Earth, what you would have is a mile-wide asteroid striking the planet's surface at about 30,000 mph. An asteroid that big traveling at that speed has the energy roughly equal to a 1 million megaton bomb.
We now believe there are between 500 and 1,000 near-Earth asteroids larger than one kilometer in diameter.. 2000 -- Michael Paine, an Australian engineer, announces a new computer analysis of asteroid impacts indicating that asteroids may cause considerable chaos over a 100,000-year period.
2000 -- NASA's Near-Earth Asteroid Tracking System announces new data about large asteroids. Until now, scientists thought the population of large, near-Earth asteroids was between 1,000 and 2,000, but we've downgraded that number significantly, said David Rabinowitz, now at Yale University.
Big impacts are rare. The Chelyabinsk asteroid was 19 meters (62 feet) in diameter, and, on average, we should expect an impact from an object that size somewhere on Earth about once every 25 years. (Because most of the planet is covered in water, many of these go unnoticed.) A small chunk of Chelyabinsk meteorite, given to me by a friend.
Now we have the assertion, based on a computer simulation by Australian engineer Michael Paine, that during the last 10,000 years, Earth was hit about 350 times by asteroids as large as the rock that wasted 2,000 square kilometers of Siberian forest in 1908.
A particular concern was tsunamis. When an asteroid hits the ocean, which covers about 70 percent of the planet, it can trigger a tsunami. According to the simulation, the average tsunami would kill 470,000 people.

Igneous Rocks. Igneous rocks are formed from lava or magma. Magma is molten rock that is underground and lava is molten rock that erupts out on the surface. The two main types of igneous rocks are plutonic rocks and volcanic rocks. Plutonic rocks are formed when magma cools and solidifies underground.Volcanic rocks are formed from lava that flows on the surface of the Earth and other planets and then cools and solidifies. The texture of an igneous rock depends on the size of the crystals in the rock.This tells us if the rock is plutonic or volcanic. When magma cools underground, it cools very slowly and when lava cools above ground, it cools quickly. When magma and lava cool, mineral crystals start to form in the molten rock.his tells us if the rock is plutonic or volcanic.

Magma (from Greek μάγμα, thick unguent) is a mixture of molten or semi-molten rock, volatiles and solids that is found beneath the surface of the Earth, and is expected to exist on other terrestrial planets. Besides molten rock, magma may also contain suspended crystals, dissolved gas and sometimes gas bubbles.agma is a complex high-temperature fluid substance. Temperatures of most magmas are in the range 700 °C to 1300 °C (or 1300 °F to 2400 °F), but very rare carbonatite magmas may be as cool as 600 °C, and komatiite magmas may have been as hot as 1600 °C. Most magmas are silicate mixtures.
Extrusive igneous rock. Extrusive, or volcanic, igneous rock is produced when magma ex its and cools outside of, or very near the Earth's surface. These are the rocks that form at erupting volcanoes and oozing fissures.The magma, called lava when molten rock erupts on the surface, cools and solidifies almost instantly when it is exposed to the relatively cool temperature of the atmosphere.e can learn something about the way a rock formed from by looking carefully at the evidence preserved inside. What a rock is made of, the shapes of the grains or crystals within the rock, and how the grains or crystals fit together all provide valuable clues to help us unlock the rock's history hidden within.
This creates a volcano. When the magma cools it turns into solid rock, called extrusive igneous rock. Magma that cools underground forms solid rock called intrusive igneous rock. Areas of rock can move slowly upwards, pushed up by pressure of the rocks forming underneath. This is called uplift.Weathering breaks down rocks on the surface of the Earth.agma that cools underground forms solid rock called intrusive igneous rock.

Magma often collects in magma chambers that may feed a volcano or solidify underground to form an intrusion. Magma is capable of intrusion into adjacent rocks (forming igneous dikes and sills), extrusion onto the surface as lava, and explosive ejection as tephra to form pyroclastic rock.agma is a complex high-temperature fluid substance.

In a 2008 study, researchers followed 21,327 male physicians for 20 years and found that egg consumption-up to 6 per week-was not linked with a greater risk of heart attack, stroke or dying from all causes.
Once demonised as bad for the heart, eggs have been repositioned as a health food in recent years as researchers have found that not only are they good for hearts, but can even help you to lose weight. But last week Canadian researchers published findings that could crack eggs’ nutritious reputation.
In a 2008 study, men who ate 7 or more eggs per week versus less than one had a twofold greater risk for all cause mortality, presumably from heart disease.
The concern with eggs has to do with their high cholesterol content - 190 milligrams per one egg. Nutrition guidelines to keep LDL (bad) blood cholesterol in the desirable range have emphasized limiting dietary cholesterol-abundant in egg yolks, shrimp, liver and duck-to less than 300 milligrams per day.
In the Department of Health analysis it was found that eggs contain around 20 per cent less fat, 13 per cent fewer calories and 10 per cent less cholesterol than 30 years ago. In one study, overweight women had eggs or a bagel for breakfast.
And if you are also eating a diet high in saturated fat, the cholesterol in eggs can have a more profound effect on your bad “LDL” cholesterol levels. Eating the same foods day after day may help you maintain your weight. “It’s about limiting choices,” explains Smith.
Eggs are well known for their protein but they also contain vitamins B-12 and A. One large egg has 78 calories and 6.3 grams of quality protein. This means that women get 14 percent and men gain 11 percent of their recommended daily allowance of protein.
I know they contain cholesterol, but I’m currently eating six a day while cutting.”. A: Whoa, there! Six eggs a day is far too many, no matter how you cut it. An egg has 187 mg of cholesterol, and the recommended limit is 300 mg per day—or only 200 mg if you have diabetes or risk factors for heart disease.
The Department of Health now says we can eat as many eggs as we like, as long as they form part of a healthy, balanced diet. There is no upper limit, says Bond, unless you have inherited high cholesterol. Of the Canadian study, she says that carotid plaque rises anyway with age after 40.
If you're healthy, one whole egg a day seems perfectly safe. If you're a male with diabetes, it's prudent to limit egg yolks to four per week.

**Average National SAT Scores for 2014**. Answer: Your SAT score can range anywhere from a 600 on the very lowest end, to a 2400 on the very highest end since each SAT section (Critical Reading, Writing, and Mathematics) is worth between 200 and 800 points a piece.
Average SAT scores for the Class of 2014 stayed about the same as previous years, hitting just below 1500 for all three portions of the college admissions exam, according to data released by College Board.
The scores from each section can range from 200 to 800, so the best possible total score is 2400. The average score for each section is roughly 500, so the average total score is about 1500. For the 1.66 million test-takers in 2013, the mean scores were 496 critical reading, 514 math, and 488 writing.
So what is a good SAT score? The exam consists of three parts: Critical Reading, Mathematics and Writing. The scores from each section can range from 200 to 800, so the best possible total score is 2400. The average score for each section is roughly 500, so the average total score is about 1500.
Above average SAT/ACT scores will improve your chances of getting into a more selective school. Scores below an 1100 on the SAT or a 15 on ACT are considered low at just about any four-year college. You can overcome low scores with good grades or an outstanding application.
So you've taken the SAT and gotten your score back, and you want to know how you did. Or maybe you're planning for the SAT, and want to know what score to aim for. Here we answer that question, with an idea of the national average and what a generally good score is.
Well, it all depends on the colleges you are considering. A 23 on the ACT or a 1800 on the SAT may be above average at one university but below average at another. The higher your score, the more options are open to you.
Your SAT score can range anywhere from a 600 on the very lowest end, to a 2400 on the very highest end since each SAT section (Critical Reading, Writing, and Mathematics) is worth between 200 and 800 points a piece. The average overall score (50th percentile) in the United States for 2014 was a 1497:
A mother recently asked me what constitutes a good SAT scores. I told her that it depends on the caliber of the school. At some colleges a 1600 out of a 2400 score is above average while at other schools, applicants with that kind of score wouldn’t even be seriously considered.
Is 2100 good? Or would only a perfect 2400 be considered a good score? However, instead of asking what score is a good one, perhaps the more important question is to ask, “Which college do you want to go to?” Different colleges have different SAT score ranges amongst their admitted applicants.

A simple saltwater gargle is prepared by dissolving 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoons of salt in an 8-ounce glass of warm water and use it as you would any mouthwash, by throwing your head back and gargling right before it hits the cartilaginous flap in the back of your throat.

I woke up with a sore throat 10 hours ago and immediately began gargling with salt water. But gargling's really a nuisance. If it's mostly to relieve discomfort, then I have other alternatives.
Salt water gargle may also loosen thick mucus and help to remove irritants like allergens, bacteria and fungi from the throat. If the gargle has a higher salt concentration than patient cells' salt concentration, it will tend to draw out some of the fluid from the swollen mucosa of the throat. Some of the symptoms will improve, but salt water gargle can’t cure the infection and remove the cause of the sore throat.
Gargling salt water may help with a sore, itchy throat and respiratory congestion. Problems with throat are actually caused by inflammation of the tissues. A sense of fullness and difficulty swallowing are both related to swelling of the tissue lining the throat, known as mucosa.
A new study shows people who gargled every day with water had fewer colds than those who didn't gargle or those who gargled with an antiseptic mouth rinse containing iodine.
What are the benefits of gargling with salt water? - Answered by a verified Health Professional
Hello, Gargling with salt water helps to relieve the discomfort of sore throat. Salt water gargling can help to flush out the area of the throat. Due to salt there can be an osmotic effect on the inflammed tissues & bacteria to draw out fluid & help in inflammation. I hope this information helps. I will be happy to assist, if you need any clarification.

Like other drugs, however, statins have potentially serious side effects, and there are instances in which they should not be taken. Here is a rundown of things you should look out for if you are taking a statin, and times when you should steer clear of the drugs altogether.
Statins are a group of medicines that can help lower the level of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in the blood. LDL cholesterol is often referred to as bad cholesterol, and statins reduce the production of it inside the liver.
Introduction. Statins are a group of medicines that can help lower the level of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in the blood. LDL cholesterol is often referred to as bad cholesterol, and statins reduce the production of it inside the liver.
Most statins are taken at night, as this is when most of your cholesterol is produced. Check with your doctor or pharmacist when you should be taking your statin. Most statins come as tablets. The most common one is simvastatin.
Like other drugs, however, statins have potentially serious side effects, and there are instances in which they should not be taken. Here is a rundown of things you should look out for if you are taking a statin, and times when you should steer clear of the drugs altogether. Next: Muscle pain and weakness.
In other words, anyone at high enough risk who stands to benefit from a statin should be taking one. It doesn’t matter so much what his or her actual cholesterol level is to begin with. And there’s no proof that an LDL cholesterol of 70 mg/dL is better than 80 or 90 mg/dL.
It’s important to take your medication regularly as prescribed. Most statins are taken at night, as this is when most of your cholesterol is produced. Check with your doctor or pharmacist when you should be taking your statin. Most statins come as tablets.

Investigate your GPS options and if you can get the display into decimal degrees like 117.4974 degrees, then you do not need to use this calculator. Test by clicking to calculate the result with the default numbers. The answer should be 117.4974 decimal degrees. i.e. just under 117 and a half degrees.
A minute of arc (MOA), arcminute (arcmin) or minute arc is a unit of angular measurement equal to one-sixtieth (1⁄60) of one degree. As one degree is 1⁄360 of a circle, one minute of arc is 1⁄21600 of a circle (or, in radians, π⁄10800). It is used in fields that involve very small angles, such as astronomy, optometry, ophthalmology, optics, navigation, land surveying and marksmanship.
Knowing that 1 radian = 57.29578 degrees we can now find the conversion factor for converting back. Dividing both sides of the equation by 57.29578 we get about 0.01745329 radians = 1 degrees. So, the conversion factor to multiply by to convert from degrees to radians is about 0.01745329.
Degrees, Minutes, Seconds to Decimal Degrees calculator and vice-versa. Overwrite the default numbers in the bright blue boxes below with the latitude or longitude of your location. Input positive numbers only (e.g. 0 to 360 deg).
Decimal degrees. 6 decimal places. The calculation equation is simply: Decimal degrees = whole number of degrees, plus minutes divided by 60, plus seconds divided by 3600. Reverse process: Input decimal degrees and the result is given in deg/min/sec format.
Say you want to convert from radians to degrees. Since you can multiply anything by 1 and still retain the original value, but in different units, set it up so that radian will cancel out leaving you with degree. Since: 1 degree = 0.01745329 radians, 1 degree / 0.01745329 radians = 1. We can write the conversion as: 1 radian = 1 radian * (1 degree / 0.01745329 radians) = 57.29578 degrees. And we now have our factor for conversion from radians to degrees since 1 * 57.29578 = 57.29578. Note that there are rounding errors in these values.
The angle would be this many degrees, (* means times.): That is, we have 40 full degrees, 20 minutes-each 1/60 of a degree, and 50 seconds-each 1/60 of 1/60 of a degree. Work that out and you will get a decimal number of degrees. It's 40.34722... Going the other way is a bit more difficult. Suppose we start with 40.3472 degrees.
Each degree is split up into 60 parts, each part being 1/60 of a degree. These parts are called minutes. Each minute is split up into 60 parts, each part being 1/60 of a minute. These parts are called seconds. The size of an angle could be stated this way: 40 degrees, 20 minutes, 50 seconds. There are symbols that are used when stating angles using degrees, minutes, and seconds.
286.4789 degrees / 57.29578 [degrees / radian] = 5 radians. To convert among any units in the left column, say from A to B, you can multiply by the factor for A to convert A into degrees then divide by the factor for B to convert out of degrees.
If you have a GPS receiver display like 117 degrees and 29 minutes and 50.5 seconds then put the numbers in all three blue boxes above in the same manner as shown with the default numbers.

As for the paddles, their response is a bit slow and inconsistent, and the gearbox will automatically upshift at redline, which always seems to arrive more quickly than anticipated. Elsewhere behind the wheel, the Stinger GT presents an excellent driver’s seat with adjustable side bolsters.
Powerful all-new Fastback Sport Sedan Redefines the Kia Brand. 1  Kia Motors follows through on the promise of a production model of the GT concept. 2  Designed in Frankfurt, developed on the Nurburgring, industry-leading quality by Kia.
Setting the manufacturing hard-points of the body-in-white would define Stinger and the engineers looked carefully across a landscape dotted with contenders. At 114.4 inches, the Stinger’s wheelbase is longer than the Audi A5 Sportback, Infiniti Q50, Lexus IS, BMW 4 Gran Coupe and the Lexus GS 5. It’s also longer overall (190.2 inches) and wider (73.6 inches) than several others in the segment. With a generous 23.3 cu.-ft. of cargo space, the Stinger’s cargo area is also larger than many of its competitors, with enough space for full-size luggage or golf bags and a power liftgate with Smart Trunk functionality is available.
Some aspects of the car are deliberately softened to make it more pleasant in real-world driving, though not so much as to hurt its sporty character on a back road. Rather than take on an M4 or C63, the Stinger GT hopes to muscle in on the 440i M Sport and C43 AMG.
I was thinking about all of this just before setting out on the Nürburgring Nordscheife in the 2018 Kia Stinger GT, less than four hours’ drive from the Scorpions hometown in Hanover, wondering if this wildly out of character Kia would inspire any feelings similar to the first time I heard that song.
Being Kia’s second-ever rear-drive sedan, it’s first-ever sport sedan, and the quickest car the company has ever sold, placing the Stinger and Stinger GT in the automotive world can be difficult.
Larger and heavier than most cars Kia benchmarked, such as the 3 Series, A4, and C-Class, the Stinger GT is incredibly neutral on track. Weight transfers smoothly while mid-corner bumps are absorbed skillfully and without upsetting the chassis.

2018 Kia Stinger GT Track Drive Review. “Rock You Like A Hurricane” is the song that got me into rock ’n’ roll, the first song I learned on the cheap Squire Stratocaster copy I begged my mom to buy me, and the reason every Motor Trend test car has SiriusXM’s Hair Nation stored in its radio presets.
The Stinger’s stance and visual balance are designed to lend the car an air of elegance and athleticism, rather than boy-racer aggression. The wide front and rear track, along with the recessed contours along the doors, enhance the visual power of the Stinger’s shoulder line as well as its fastback silhouette.

Though there are dozens, if not hundreds, of lake monsters around the world, one superstar marine denizen outshines them all: Nessie, the beast said to inhabit Scotland's Loch Ness. Some say it's a myth; others say it's a living dinosaur or even a sea serpent that swam into the lake before it became landlocked.
Besides, Loch Ness is landlocked and well above sea level, so there is no way for a large sea creature to get there, especially since we know plesiosaurs could not crawl on land. Cultural: As Daniel Loxton and I showed in our book, the “plesiosaur” meme about the Loch Ness monster is a recent invention.
The Loch Ness monster story is buoyed by occasional photographs and sightings, though there is no hard evidence of Nessie's existence: no bodies (or even parts of bodies) have been found on the lake bottom or washed ashore.
The Loch Ness Monster, better known as “Nessie”, is located in Loch Ness in the Highlands of Scotland. The lake is 23 miles long, about 1 mile wide, and it runs southwest to northeast.
Dozens of inconclusive and ambiguous photos, films, and videos have surfaced over the years, but the monster apparently has not. Loch Ness itself has been repeatedly searched for more than 70 years, using everything from miniature submarines to divers.
The legend of the Loch Ness monster is one of the most popular and enduring of all the tall tales of cryptozoology—and ironically, one of the most easily debunked as well. In our book Abominable Science! , Daniel Loxton and I laid the entire myth to rest about as conclusively as one can debunk something.
Though there are dozens, if not hundreds, of lake monsters around the world, one superstar marine denizen outshines them all: Nessie, the beast said to inhabit Scotland's Loch Ness.
Many have tried and failed to prove the existence of the Loch Ness Monster-now Google has joined the search. On the banks of Loch Ness (Photo: Google). The firm has, with the help of divers and local experts, used its Street View cameras to capture parts of the Scottish loch, the reputed home of the famous cryptid.
If I had a million quid .. what I would do at Loch Ness! The Nessie search has always been underfunded and reliant on donors. That doesn't mean nothing worthy has not been done but too many have presumed lack of results is not due to funding issues but ... because nothing is there.
From the royal stable of thoroughbreds to her loft of racing pigeons, the Queen’s fascination with creatures great and small is a lifelong affair. But until now nothing has been known of the monarch’s passion for another sizeable beast of her dominion-the Loch Ness Monster.

Vatican City is distinct from the Holy See (Latin: Sancta Sedes), which dates back to early Christianity and is the main episcopal see of 1.2 billion Latin and Eastern Catholic adherents around the globe.
Vatican City - Politics, government, and taxation. The Holy See is a monarchical-sacerdotal state, which is to say that it operates as a monarchy in which the Pope is the king (monarchical), with senior members of the church hierarchy, appointed by the Pope, as the governing body (sacerdotal).
The name Vatican City was first used in the Lateran Treaty, signed on 11 February 1929, which established the modern city-state. The name is taken from Vatican Hill, the geographic location of the state.
Vatican City (/ˈvætᵻkən ˈsɪti/; Italian: Città del Vaticano [tʃitˈta ddel vatiˈkaːno]; Latin: Civitas Vaticana), officially Vatican City State or the State of Vatican City (Italian: Stato della Città del Vaticano; Latin: Status Civitatis Vaticanae), is a walled enclave within the city of Rome.
State Departments. Vatican City State is governed as an absolute monarchy. The Head of State is the Pope who holds full legislative, executive and judicial powers. During a sede vacante (between the death of a Pope and the election of his successor), these powers are exercised by the College of Cardinals.
Transcript of Vatican City: a Modern Theocracy. Where Is It? Vatican City (Vatican City State) ia a walled enclave within the city of Rome and is the smallest internationally recongnized independant state in the world by both area and population.
Vatican City is the smallest country in the world. Encircled by a 2-mile border with Italy, Vatican City is an independent city-state that covers just over 100 acres, making it one-eighth the size of New York’s Central Park. Vatican City is governed as an absolute monarchy with the pope at its head. The Vatican mints its own euros, prints its own stamps, issues passports and license plates, operates media outlets and has its own flag and anthem. One government function it lacks: taxation.
It is as the Holy See rather than the State of the Vatican that the country sends and receives diplomatic representatives to and from around the world. The head of government, generally a cardinal or archbishop whose appointment and authority is conferred by the Pope, is the secretary of state.
Vatican City Explained. Script. Vatican City: capitol of the Catholic Church, home to the pope, owner of impressive collections of art and history all contained within the borders of the world's smallest country: conveniently circumnavigateable on foot in only 40 minutes.
Now back to the King. The King of Vatican City has absolute, unchecked power within the country's borders and his presence makes Vatican City one of only six remanning absolute monarchies in the world, including Brunei, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and Swaziland.
Causes of its Failure: The League of Nations was the first major attempt as an international organization of state to maintain peace and promote international co-operation. But it failed. 1. The political background of Europe at the time of the birth of the League was not very conducive to a peace organization.
Weaknesses and Failure of the League of the Nations Weaknesses and Failure of the League of the Nations The onset of the Second World War demonstrated that the... League had failed in its primary purpose, which was to avoid any future world war.
Teschen, Upper Silesia, Memel, Mosul, Leticia, Greece Bulgaria border dispute, aaland isalnds, yugoslavia albania border dispute. what were the political successes of the League of Nations. the league was able to arbitrate the dispute and and split the region between Poland and czechoslovakia. how was Teschen a success. the league decided divide the region of silesia between poland and germany and both of the countries agreed.
Failure of the League of Nations that the covenant of the League of Nations was made a part parcel of the peace settlement. It would have been better if it had... kept separate. There were many states which consider the Treaty Of Versailles as a treaty of revenge, and were not prepared to ratify the same.
The failure of the League of Nations also contributed significantly to the Second World War. After WWI ended, countries such as Canada, France and Britain. formed the League of Nations, an international organization intended to maintain world peace.
how was the treaty of riga a failure. the league was forced not to take action because all votes of the council had to be unanimous. how was the invasion of the ruhr a failure. it demonstrated lack of power on behalf of the league of nations when confronted by a greater power.
Failure Of The League Of Nations LEAGUE OF NATIONS [FAILURES]- While the League of Nations could celebrate its... successes, the League had every reason to examine its failures and where it went wrong.
But it failed. Some of the causes of its failure are briefly mentioned as follows:—. 1. The political background of Europe at the time of the birth of the League was not very conducive to a peace organization. World War I had been fought ostensibly to make the world safe for democracy, to end all future wars, etc.
Therefore, the failure of the League of Nations was an important cause of the Second World War. Another important cause of the Second World War was the policy of appeasement. The policy of appeasement was basically the policy to give into the demands of an unfriendly power—Germany—to prevent hostilities.
Causes of WWII— Treaty of Versailles, Failure of the League of Nations, and Policy of Appeasement. The Treaty of Versailles made at the end of WWI was a major cause of the Second World War. The Treaty of Versailles had severe conditions and demanded Germany to pay a huge amount of money for the damages that they had done to the victorious countries.
The argument is nothing new. The LPN is quick to tell you she does so much more than make beds, give back rubs, and take vital signs. And the RN counters that she has more education and medical training and is called upon for more advanced procedures.
As someone with RN training and no LPN experience, I'm still honestly confused by these two different nurse licenses.... so here goes... Many say a nurse is a nurse but that's not always the case. There is different designation and licensing for RNs and LPNs.
However, under licensure, the LPN cannot interpret data, or make decisions for the patient. She has to report these findings to the RN or MD and they will make the decisions and delegate care. Because of the scope of their practice is limited by their license, it may seem like LPNs do less than RNs. The fact is, the LPN may only perform her job as far as she is legally allowed to.
LPN vs. RN: What's the Difference? The decision to apply to nursing school is perhaps the most important career decision nurses make, but it is only the first. The second? Deciding whether to become a licensed practical nurse (LPN) or a registered nurse (RN).
RN training requirements. The BLS notes that RNs can typically choose one of three education paths, namely: a diploma from an accredited nursing program, an associate degree in nursing (ADN) or a bachelor's of science degree in nursing (BSN).
They both work under RNs and doctors. LPN and LVN programs prepare you to take the NCLEX-PN. Passing the NCLEX-PN is required for licensure of both LPNs and LVNs. The biggest difference between a Licensed Vocational Nurse (LVN) and a Licensed Practical Nurse (LPN) is actually the name.
Among them: 1  RNs tend to have more responsibilities and independence in the workplace than LPNs. 2  RNs must usually complete more training than LPNs. 3  LPNs are in higher demand than RNs, nationally speaking.  RNs tend to earn more than LPNs.
Within the nursing field are a number of titles, including Licensed Practical Nurse (LPN), Licensed Vocational Nurse (LVN) and Registered Nurse (RN). This post will help clarify some of the differences, qualifications and responsibilities of LPNs and LVNs. Licensed Vocational Nurses vs. Licensed Practical Nurses.
LPNs vs. RNs. Licensed practical or vocational nurses represent the entry level of the profession. Their duties are confined to the basics of patient care, such as monitoring vital signs; helping patients bathe and addressing personal hygiene; assisting as needed at mealtime; and updating charts.
The nursing profession is one of the most diverse in the health-care industry. Direct patient care is the nurse's primary responsibility, but this care takes many forms. At the entry level, licensed practical nurses and inexperienced registered nurses spend much of their time performing basic care of the bedpans and bathing variety.
A few questions about a staple down/Gypcrete installation. The way Ive done this in the past is have the homeowner double the sill plates so there is a nailer for the sheet rock. The gypcrete company doing the pour wants the sheetrock installed before the pour without doubling the plates.I have also put the heat on only one day after the pour but Im told by this company it should cure a minimum of 14 days before applying heat. Ive read in the past where the heat was on during the pour. have also put the heat on only one day after the pour but Im told by this company it should cure a minimum of 14 days before applying heat.

I live in a 6 y.o. condo w/ gypcrete floors on the second level of the house-which is over a garage. I wanted to install wood floor but the gypcrete was very unlevel across the floor.

Our floors are concrete with no insulation--just slab. We want to install radiant heat to run off our PV system, and have a finish layer poured over. We've read about the energy loss if the slab is not insulated.onding of the upper finish layer of concrete and the lower existing layer is not as important on an interior application where the slab is contained. There are a few items which you should consider in making your decision prior to proceeding.
Before, during and after installation of a Maxxon underlayment, building interior shall be enclosed and maintained at a temperature above 50 F (10 C) until structure and subfloor temperatures are stabilized.Maxxon gypsum underlayments are inorganic and provide no source of nutrients to sustain mold growth.oisture can be introduced by other trades through spillage, tracked in mud and rain, plumbing leaks, etc. Often stored in damp conditions, building products may arrive on site laden with moisture that releases after installation. Outside sources such as rain, snow, wind, etc. can also increase moisture levels.

Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia are cruel diseases that progress over time and eventually lead to death. Alzheimer's disease is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States. Dementia is a progressive disease that affects the brain. Early stages of dementia might show up as memory problems, confusion, and sundowning (confusion starting late in the day, lasting into the night).
In 1998, Alzheimer's disease was the 12th-leading cause of death in the United States, with 22,725 deaths, and the ninth-leading cause for people 65 and over. That number is expected to increase when statistics for 1999 are released.
Doctors do not understand why most cases of early onset Alzheimer's appear at such a young age. But in a few hundred families worldwide, scientists have pinpointed several rare genes that directly cause Alzheimer's. People who inherit these rare genes tend to develop symptoms in their 30s, 40s and 50s.
Alzheimer's is not just a disease of old age. Younger-onset (also known as early-onset) Alzheimer's affects people younger than age 65. Up to 5 percent of the more than 5 million Americans with Alzheimer’s have younger-onset.
Question: What are the Causes of Death in People with Alzheimer's Disease? The Alzheimer's Association notes that Alzheimer's disease is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States. It also points out that out of the top ten causes of death, it's the only one without an effective treatment or cure.
People who have early onset Alzheimer's may be in any stage of dementia – early stage, middle stage or late stage. The disease affects each person differently and symptoms will vary. If you are experiencing memory problems: Have a comprehensive medical evaluation with a doctor who specializes in Alzheimer's disease.
Such incapacitation again sets the stage for deadly infections. Doctors say it is possible that an Alzheimer's patient could progress to the point that damage from the disease to the centers of the brain that control breathing could cause death, but patients rarely get that far without an infection setting in.
Early-onset Alzheimer's disease. Early-onset Alzheimer's disease, also called early-onset Alzheimer's, or early-onset AD, is Alzheimer's disease diagnosed before the age of 65. It is an uncommon form of Alzheimer's, accounting for only 5-10% of all Alzheimer's cases.
See our explainers here. Summitt, 64, died Tuesday morning, five years after being diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer’s disease. While her death was reported as a result of the disease, Alzheimer’s in and of itself does not kill a person. Yet last year nearly 100,000 people in the United States died because of it.
Another study that examined autopsy reports of people with dementia found the main causes of death were pneumonia, cardiovascular diseases, pulmonary embolism, cachexia, and dehydration. Other factors that impact the death rate in Alzheimer's disease include advanced age, increased falls and delirium.
Clan/Family Histories. - Muir/Moore. Since the Scots word muir means a moor or a heath and there are a multiplicity of place names incorporating the word, it is not surprising that the surname is found all over Scotland. It is particularly prolific in west-central Scotland and in Orkney the name is one of the top ten most commonly found names.
Origins in Ulster: Plantation Scottish. The surname derives from the old English personal name Arcebald, Arcenbald or even Ercenbald meaning either “right bold” or “holy prince”. The first of the name in Scotland was Archebaldus filius Swani de Forgrunde in the reign of William the Lion.

Last name: Moore. This distinguished British surname recorded in a wide range of spellings including: More, Mores, Moor, Moores, Moors, and in Scotland Muir, has a number of possible origins.
‘Jenkin Moore, Deemster, a.d. 1499.’ More is the usual form till the end of the sixteenth century. It is a common name in Ireland, Scotland, and the North of England, as well as in the Isle of Man.
The De La Mare surname from French Normandy was progressively anglicized in England as de la Mare (Walter de la Mare), De La More, More, and Moore in England. Frequency. In the United States, Moore ranked 16th among all surnames in the 2000 census, accounting for 0.26% of the population, falling from 9th in the 1990 census.
Of thirteen families of Moore recorded in Burke’s Landed Gentry of Ireland (1912), twelve claim to have come to Ireland as settlers from England or Scotland and only one to be an offshoot of the O’Mores.

If the salmon is farmed, it is not an issue. If it is wild salmon, the fish live much longer and get much larger (and by consequence have far more stored mercury within their fat/flesh). Farmed salmon are raised and killed long before they amass a worrisome amount of mercury. Also, it depends on your gender.
Salmon is rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which help reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke and may reduce coronary artery disease and help lower blood pressure. MayoClinic.com recommends eating salmon or other omega-rich fish twice weekly. Although seafood is often contaminated, salmon is a low-mercury choice. Therefore, Consumer Reports deems it safe to eat salmon every day -- unlike swordfish and fresh tuna, which have dangerous mercury levels.
Eating tuna every day may increase mercury levels in your body. Photo Credit fotomania_17/iStock/Getty Images. The American Heart Association recommends eating omega-3-rich fish, such as tuna, twice a week for good health. It's wise, however, to vary what you choose. Because tuna is a source of mercury, you should avoid eating it daily, especially higher-mercury varieties like albacore tuna.
The 5 Safest Fish to Eat - Salmon, tilapia, rainbow trout and more. More people than ever are asking what seafood is safe for dinner. As parents, we also want fish that’s delicious and stocked with the nutrients our kids need. Here are the five best fish for the environment, growing brains and bodies, and finicky taste buds. Salmon.
Dangers of Too Much Mercury from Tuna. Mercury is a poisonous metal that can have serious health consequences, such as injury to the brain, heart, kidneys and lungs. It's especially harmful to children and pregnant women because it can affect development of the child and growing fetus.
I figure this is as good a subreddit as any to ask this. I've been doing keto for about a month and have been getting killer results! There is a killer sushi place where I get sashimi on a bed of spinach everyday for lunch. My coworkers have expressed concern over mercury poisoning etc.
Salmon is low in calories and high in nutrients. Salmon has no magical fat-burning properties, and eating it won't directly affect your weight. However, salmon is a lean protein that fits nicely into a healthy diet plan. Replacing fatty red meats and junk food in your diet with salmon may reduce overall calorie intake, eventually helping you lose body fat.
Also, to get your weekly seafood needs for good health, mix it up. Include different types of fish in your diet that have less mercury but are good sources of omega-3s, such as salmon, anchovies and sardines. Also include other types of seafood or fish, such as shrimp, scallops, tilapia and haddock.
A friend tried warning me about mercury poisoning because I eat tuna (canned albacore) more than 3x/week. It still doesn't worry me. I don't plan on getting pregnant and I guess albacore is a bit higher in mercury than other canned fish.
Nowadays, the situation is a bit more complicated, but canned or fresh, tuna is still one of the top fish to feed children. It has a fantastic roster of nutrients – plenty of omega 3s, yes, but also lots of vitamin A and magnesium.
There are several different copper fungicides approved for use in organically-produced crops. Copper fungicides are important tools for managing diseases that cannot be effectively managed with cultural practices alone. They have broad-spectrum activity, acting on bacteria as well as fungi.
Some advanced organic gardeners don't even use any natural pesticides or fungicides, because their soil structure and garden techniques encourage massive populations of beneficials. However, there are exceptions where a few ideas are needed to control pests.
2 Comments on 5 Organic Fungicides for the Vegetable Garden. 1  I do not comment, however after looking at a few of the. 2  Just a quick question… I started an Avocado Tree this summer, and it's PINK! I was told it is a Fungus that causes this discoloration, so I'm adding Baking soda to it's daily water.
Following many years of use, there is a lot more information on efficacy of copper fungicides than the newer biological products. Manufacturers of some biologicals recommend that they be used in a management program with copper fungicides (often in alternation or at low label rate).
Damping-off is less of a problem if the seed are planted in soil within the desirable temperature range for a particular vegetable. For example, garden peas and potatoes may be planted in relatively cool soil, whereas squash, beans, or cucumbers must be planted in fairly warm soil.
Broad-spectrum fungicides for vegetables. Check out these broad-spectrum fungicide options available for use on multiple vegetable crops. Chlorothalonil (Bravo/Echo/Equus) is a FRAC M5 fungicide that is well known for its ease of use as a stand-alone product or tank mix partner for protecting against a range of pathogens of vegetable crops.
For example, if a short-season vegetable that is susceptible to root-knot nematodes is grown in one area of the garden, you can often produce a fall crop (such as a resistant variety of tomato or sweet corn) in the same soil without a yield loss. Plan a rotational program by dividing the garden site into thirds.
Spray the plants weekly—either with a natural fungicide, compost tea (home made or one of the super-charged compost teas being brewed at larger garden centers) or The Cornell Formula: A table spoon each of baking soda and vegetable or horticultural oil, plus two drops of dish washing soap, in a gallon of water.
Soil Guardian for Soilbourne Diseases. Soil Guardian is a preventive biological fungicide that can be used on fruiting vegetables, herbs and leafy vegetables. The active ingredient is a microbe that provides protection to plant roots against soilbourne diseases.
5 Organic Fungicides for the Vegetable Garden. There are many times that vegetable gardeners may run into issues with blights, mildews, leaf spots and other fungi that attack plants. These fungi can quickly damage a vegetable plant causing it to become unproductive or even dead.

Your neck is flexible and supports the weight of your head, so it can be vulnerable to injuries and conditions that cause pain and restrict motion. Neck pain causes include: Muscle strains. Overuse, such as too many hours hunched over your computer or smartphone, often triggers muscle strains.
Arthritis is one cause of cervical radiculopathy. Cervical spondylosis is caused by degenerative changes in the bones and intervertebral discs of the neck. A less technical name for this condition is osteoarthritis of the neck, or degenerative disc disease of the neck. Typically, arthritis in the neck starts at about 40 years of age, and as you get older it will likely continue to progress. Men tend to develop cervical spondylosis at a younger age than women.
Thyroid cancer Thyroid cancer is cancer of the thyroid gland and can cause a cough, hoarseness, a lump in the neck, and more. Thyroid nodules Thyroid nodules usually don't cause symptoms, but can cause a visible lump, neck pain, hoarseness, and more.

The rotator cuff develops wear and tear with age, and can be easily injured. When this happens, we compensate by using different muscles to pick things up or reach for them. “This may cause both shoulder and neck pain,” says Dr. Ricchetti. You may have a rotator cuff injury or other shoulder problem if pain:
Neck pain is a common complaint. Neck muscles can be strained from poor posture — whether it's leaning over your computer or hunching over your workbench. Osteoarthritis also is a common cause of neck pain. Rarely, neck pain can be a symptom of a more serious problem. Seek medical care if your neck pain is accompanied by numbness or loss of strength in your arms or hands or if you have shooting pain into your shoulder or down your arm.
Osteoarthritis causes the cushions (cartilage) between your bones (vertebrae) to deteriorate. Your body then forms bone spurs that affect joint motion and cause pain. Nerve compression. Herniated disks or bone spurs in the vertebrae of your neck can press on the nerves branching out from the spinal cord. Injuries.
Broken (fractured) collarbone Broken collarbones are usually caused by a blow to the shoulder and causes pain and swelling in that area. Whiplash Whiplash, a severe neck injury, can cause stiffness and pain in the neck, headache, dizziness, and more. Hypothyroidism (adult) Hypothyroidism your body functions slow down, making you gain weight and feel tired all the time.
When the neck is the likely culprit. Inflammation of any of the 14 nerves or eight pairs of joints in the neck can cause neck pain. The joints — or vertebrae — serve as a hinge that lets us nod or shake our heads during conversation (no wonder they wear out).
Inductance, in particular, plays an important part in obtaining proper puddle fluidity. The shielding gas recommended for short-circuiting welding of stainless-steel contains 90% helium, 7.5% argon, and 2.5% carbon dioxide.The gas gives the most desirable bead contour while keeping the CO2 level low enough so that it does not influence the corrosion resistance of the metal. current of approximately 300-350 amperes is required for a 1/16-in. electrode, depending on the shielding gas and type of stainless wire being used. The degree of spatter is dependent upon the composition and flow rate of the shielding gas, wire-feed speed, and the characteristics of the welding power supply.
The basic gas for MIG/MAG welding is argon (Ar). Helium (He) can be added to increase penetration and fluidity of the weld pool. Argon or argon/helium mixtures can be used for welding all grades.or stainless steels there are also gases available containing small amounts of hydrogen (H 2). The table indicates the appropriate choice of shielding gas for MIG/MAG welding, taking account of different types of stainless steel and arc types.
The normal gas for TIG welding is argon (Ar). Helium (He) can be added to increase penetration and fluidity of the weld pool. Argon or argon/helium mixtures can be used for welding all grades.In some cases nitrogen (N 2) and/or hydrogen (H 2) can be added in order to achieve special properties.or stainless steels there are also gases available containing small amounts of hydrogen (H 2). The table indicates the appropriate choice of shielding gas for MIG/MAG welding, taking account of different types of stainless steel and arc types.
While Ar, He and CO2 may be used by themselves (i.e. 100%) for certain applications, in other cases the four gases are mixed together in different combinations to form shielding gas blends. These blends are expressed as a percentage (e.g. 75% Ar / 25% CO2 or 75Ar/25CO2).ther gases (e.g. hydrogen) and many other gas mixes of different percentages and combination of gases are also used in the welding industry. Table 1 is simply meant to be a quick summary of the most common gases used for common types of base materials in the U.S, welding market.
Argon is a major component of shielding gas when spraylike, high-productivity welding is desired in GMAW or FCAW for joining steel and stainless steel. Helium. Helium is considerably lighter than air, which means higher flow rates are required than for argon or carbon dioxide.ou can choose from a variety of gas blends for gas metal arc welding (GMAW), gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW), or flux cored arc welding (FCAW). For each of these processes, the shielding gas performs multiple tasks.
Choosing The Right Gas. Many MIG welding applications lend themselves to a variety of shielding gas choices, and you need to evaluate your welding goals in order to choose the correct one for your specific application.IG Welding Shielding Gas Basics. MIG (GMAW) welding with shielding gas and a solid wire electrode produces a clean, slag-free weld without the need to continually stop welding to replace the electrode, as in Stick welding.
A current of approximately 300-350 amperes is required for a 1/16-in. electrode, depending on the shielding gas and type of stainless wire being used. The degree of spatter is dependent upon the composition and flow rate of the shielding gas, wire-feed speed, and the characteristics of the welding power supply. current of approximately 300-350 amperes is required for a 1/16-in. electrode, depending on the shielding gas and type of stainless wire being used. The degree of spatter is dependent upon the composition and flow rate of the shielding gas, wire-feed speed, and the characteristics of the welding power supply.
Shielding Gas and Cost-effective Joining. Shielding gas selection is critical to achieving cost-effective joining of carbon steel, stainless steel, and aluminum. You can select one gas, such as argon for aluminum welding, to provide suitable arc stability, minimum spatter, and good bead shape.ou can choose from a variety of gas blends for gas metal arc welding (GMAW), gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW), or flux cored arc welding (FCAW). For each of these processes, the shielding gas performs multiple tasks.
In some instances, consider adding helium to the shielding gas mixture for its ability to provide a hotter, more penetrating arc on thicker sections. For the GMAW process, a mixture of 75 percent helium balanced with 25 percent argon is a good option.inally, consider purchasing low-dew-point shielding gases as protection against porosity. Follow all recommended welding procedures for shielding gas flow rates and purge cycles. As with any welding process on any material, following some basic guidelines is critical to obtaining the best results.

A 150-g serving of boiled red potatoes has a glycemic index value of 89, 21 g of carbohydrate per serving and a glycemic load of 19. Because rice and potatoes are high in carbohydrates that have a significant effect on blood sugar, they have a high glycemic load, as well as a high glycemic index.
The glycemic index of a food is the measure of how likely it is to raise your blood glucose levels. A lower glycemic index indicates a safer food for diabetics. This number varies greatly depending on the type of potato or rice you eat.
The glycemic load combines the glycemic index value of a food with the amount of carbohydrates in that food to determine that food’s glycemic potency. A 150-g, or 1.5-cup, serving of boiled white rice has a glycemic index value of 83, 36 g of carbohydrate per serving and a glycemic load of 30.
Using glucose to represent 100 on the glycemic index scale, boiled white potatoes have a glycemic index of 82, instant mashed potatoes have a value of 85, and sweet potatoes a value of 70.
Similar to most types of white rice, potato, in general, has a high glycemic index, which means it is quickly broken down into glucose, and can cause blood sugar and insulin levels to rise, making you feel hungry soon after.
Glycemic Index and Diabetes. The glycemic index, or GI, measures how a carbohydrate-containing food raises blood glucose. Foods are ranked based on how they compare to a reference food — either glucose or white bread. A food with a high GI raises blood glucose more than a food with a medium or low GI.
Similar to most types of white rice, potato, in general, has a high glycemic index, which means it is quickly broken down into glucose, and can cause blood sugar and insulin levels to rise, making you feel hungry soon after. Potato is also associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes.
Because rice and potatoes are high in carbohydrates that have a significant effect on blood sugar, they have a high glycemic load, as well as a high glycemic index. By comparison, a 120-g apple has a glycemic index value of 34, 16 g of carbohydrate per serving and a glycemic load of 5.
This number varies greatly depending on the type of potato or rice you eat. According to Harvard University Medical Center, a medium-sized white potato has a glycemic index of 50, while a russet potato has a glycemic index of 85. White rice and brown rice fall between these figures, with glycemic indexes of 64 and 55.

In 1849 Pond and several partners formed the T. T. Pond Company. Mr. Pond soon sold out and died in 1852. The company moved its manufacturing facilities to Connecticut, then moved its sales offices to New York City. The company incorporated in 1914 with the name Pond's Extract Company.round that time, owing the broader availability of witch hazel at a lower price, it became clear that Pond's Extract had no future. Among the products the company developed early in the new century were Pond's Vanishing Cream and Pond's Cold Cream.

In Part 2 of MyBrainNotes.com, as part of a discussion of the VIGILANCE system, we discuss Stress, attention, learning, and memory, including the effects of stress on neurocircuitry in what is called the prefrontal cortex, a larger area also illustrated in the image to the right (links to source).
The connections of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus contribute to part of the Papez circuit (see Fig. 25-4). The anterior nucleus receives inputs from the subicular cortex of the hippocampal formation and from the mammillary bodies via the mammillothalamic tract.
The reticular nucleus of the thalamus lies just medial to the internal capsule. It differs from other thalamic nuclei in that it does not project to the cerebral cortex. Instead, it contains inhibitory neurons, which modulate thalamic neurons that project to the cortex.
In a module taken from The Brain from Top to Bottom, you can find the following excellent summary of Brodmann's Areas: The cellular architecture differs sufficiently from one part of the neocortex to another to be used as a criterion for defining cortical areas that are functionally distinct.
Association Nuclei. Association nuclei receive few, if any, afferents from ascending sensory pathways. They do, however, receive inputs from regions such as the cerebral cortex, limbic nuclei, basal ganglia, and nonspecific thalamic nuclei. Association nuclei also project to specific regions of the cerebral cortex. Their functions appear to be complex and integrative in nature and, in many cases, are not entirely understood. Figure 26-5 depicts the anatomical arrangement of the thalamic nuclei and their output relationships with the cerebral cortex.
The Brain's Cerebral Cortex (Neocortex) In Evolving Brains (2000), John Allman explains that cortex means the outer shell or rind of an object. He explains that the prefix neo implies that it is new. The brain's neocortex:
Afferent Connections of the Cerebral Cortex The Thalamus Defining Characteristics of Thalamic Nuclei In brief, the major thalamic nuclei can be divided into the following groups: anterior, medial, lateral, midline, and intralaminar nuclei. In addition, the terms specific, association, and […]
The lobe designations are sometimes used to indicate the relative position of structures. For example, the amygdalae are nestled within the temporal lobes. While we will discuss specialized areas of the neocortex later in this narrative, we will discuss the lobes in brief below.
The characteristics of specific thalamic nuclei include the following: (1) they receive specific signals from sensory pathways such as the inferior colliculus (auditory), retina (visual), medial lemniscus, and spinothalamic and trigeminothalamic tracts (somatosensory); and (2) they project topographically to specific regions of the cerebral cortex (e.g., temporal neocortex, visual cortex, and primary somatosensory cortex).
The neocortex is a specialization in the telencephalon that parallels the formation of the dorsal ventricular ridge and wulst in reptiles and birds. The neocortex is just as much a unique defining feature of mammals as are the mammary glands or the malleus and incus in the middle ear. As with the other distinctive features of mammals, the neocortex probably evolved as a part of a set of adaptations related to temperature homeostasis.
Pack Rat Infestation. Their dens are commonly located on the ground and measure 3 to 5 feet in height and diameter. One animal may inhabit several nests, and in good feeding areas a den may be occupied for several years or a lifetime. Pack rats live alone except when mating or rearing young. Circling of small trees and shrubs occurs but is not common.
Wood rats climb readily and are chiefly nocturnal; occasionally they are observed during daylight. Their food is largely determined by varying local conditions and consists mainly of a variety of green vegetation including grass, leaves, fruit, nuts, small bulbs, bark, dry seeds and fungi.
Rats are typically distinguished from mice by their size. Generally, when someone discovers a large muroid rodent, its common name includes the term rat, while if it is smaller, the name includes the term mouse. The muroid family is broad and complex, and the common terms rat and mouse are not taxonomically specific.
Fears are growing that the UK is headed for an epidemic of monstrous rodents as pictures of giant rats continue to emerge. One image, reportedly reportedly taken in Cornwall, shows a giant rat being held up by its tail - and the man holding it is 6ft 1in, giving a sense of its horrifying scale. It comes as a giant rat was caught in Liverpool, measuring two feet long from its nose to its tail. While the rats have been changing, humans have been using the same anticoagulant poisons since the 1950s. This photo shows a huge rat that was caught in Cornwall earlier this year.

Fresh ones are dark brown, but they get lighter with age. The above image of rat feces was photographed in the attic of a house with a rat problem.
This is a rat droppings page. For mice, Click here for photographs of mouse poop. The above image of rat feces was photographed in the attic of a house with a rat problem. I was able to identify the type of animal by inspecting the turds.
The best-known rat species are the black rat (Rattus rattus) and the brown rat (Rattus norvegicus). The group is generally known as the Old World rats or true rats, and originated in Asia. Rats are bigger than most Old World mice, which are their relatives, but seldom weigh over 500 grams (1.1 lb) in the wild. The term rat is also used in the names of other small mammals which are not true rats. Examples include the North American pack rats, a number of species loosely called kangaroo rats, and others.
Pack rat nests also harbor diseases other pests such as kissing bugs, brown spiders, mice and scorpions. Evidence that you have pack rats is gnawing and fecal pellets. When wood rats nest in buildings, they may utilize available foods within the building, but most often they continue to feed outside.
The Rat Terrier needs a good amount of exercise. This breed needs to be taken on a daily long walk or jog. It should have at least 20-30 minutes a day, but would enjoy much more. The breed enjoys challenging games and outdoor romps.
The smallest variety was derived from the Smooth Fox Terrier and Chihuahua. The Rat Terrier proved to be one of the best in the rat-baiting pits. One Rat Terrier is reported to have killed over 2,501 rats in a span of only seven hours in a rat infested barn. The Rat Terrier is a hard-working farm hand, able to rid an infested barn of vermin with no problem. The Rat Terrier was officially recognized by the AKC in 2013.
1 Combination tests have been developed that detect HIV antibody and the HIV antigen called the p24 antigen. 2  Levels of p24 antigen are typically high early in the course of infection. 3  A combination test may be performed to increase the likelihood that HIV infection is detected sooner after exposure occurs. Verify a positive with a second HIV antibody test that differentiates between HIV-1 and HIV-2. 2  If results between the first and second test do not agree, then the next test to perform is a HIV-1 RNA test (nucleic acid amplification test, NAAT).
Prostate-specific antigen, or PSA, is a protein produced by cells of the prostate gland. The PSA test measures the level of PSA in a man’s blood.For this test, a blood sample is sent to a laboratory for analysis.

This test looks for hepatitis B surface antigens in your blood. The test is used to find out whether you have a recent or long-standing infection from the hepatitis B virus (HBV). HBV has proteins called antigens on its surface that cause your immune system to make antibodies.It can take 30 to 150 days to develop symptoms of hepatitis B after you become infected.he test is used to find out whether you have a recent or long-standing infection from the hepatitis B virus (HBV). HBV has proteins called antigens on its surface that cause your immune system to make antibodies. It can take 30 to 150 days to develop symptoms of hepatitis B after you become infected.
Antigen/antibody tests rely on the fact that there is a specific antibody for each antigen, thus, each one can be used to detect the presence of the other. For example, a known antigen may be added to a blood sample; if the corresponding antibody is present in the specimen, the two proteins will bind together.urpose of the Antigen/Antibody Tests for Infectious Disease. 1  To aid in the diagnosis of viral, bacterial, fungal, and parasitic infections. 2  To monitor the course of an infection or autoimmune process. 3  To evaluate how protected you are against a microorganism (your immunity).
HIV antibody testing is used to screen for and diagnose HIV infections. Since there is no cure, early treatment of HIV infection and immune system monitoring can greatly improve long-term health and survival. Also, if a person knows his HIV status, it may help change behaviors that can put him and others at risk. Verify a positive with a second HIV antibody test that differentiates between HIV-1 and HIV-2. 2  If results between the first and second test do not agree, then the next test to perform is a HIV-1 RNA test (nucleic acid amplification test, NAAT).
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) tests may be used for a variety of reasons. Some of the tests detect antibodies produced in response to HBV infection; some detect antigens produced by the virus, and others detect viral DNA.The main uses for HBV tests include: test is available to determine the specific type (strain) of hepatitis B virus that is causing a person's infection. This is called HBV genotyping. However, this testing is currently mainly used in research settings and not for clinical purposes.

It is also referred to as glycated hemoglobin, glycosylated hemoglobin, hemoglobin A1C and HbA1c. Your doctor can measure you A1C number with a blood test to determine your average blood sugar levels over the past two or three months. A normal A1C level falls between 4 and 6 percent.
It is also referred to as glycated hemoglobin, glycosylated hemoglobin, hemoglobin A1C and HbA1c. Your doctor can measure you A1C number with a blood test to determine your average blood sugar levels over the past two or three months.
Your doctor can measure you A1C number with a blood test to determine your average blood sugar levels over the past two or three months. A normal A1C level falls between 4 and 6 percent. If you have type 1 or type 2 diabetes, you should strive to keep your A1C number below 7 percent. Eating right can help you do that.

The A1C test result reflects your average blood sugar level for the past two to three months. Specifically, the A1C test measures what percentage of your hemoglobin — a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen — is coated with sugar (glycated). The higher your A1C level, the poorer your blood sugar control.

In most cases, the pouches are located in the lower intestine, or the colon. Diverticulitis ». Diverticula often exist within the body without causing any additional problems, and become more common as you age. In fact, the pouches or bulges are rather common after age 40.
Diet for Diverticulitis. Gradually you can ease back into a regular diet. Your doctor may advise you to start with low-fiber foods (white bread, meat, poultry, fish, eggs, and dairy products) before introducing high-fiber foods.
The Diverticulitis Diet. It should be noted that there have also been studies that suggest eating too much fiber may lead to diverticular disease by causing more frequent bowel movements. The recommended amount of dietary fiber is 20 to 35 grams per day.
Read the Travelers' Diarrhea: What You Need to Know article > >. Many experts believe that a low-fiber diet can lead to diverticulosis and diverticulitis. This may be why people in Asia and Africa, where the diet tends to be higher in fiber, have a very low incidence of the condition.
However, on occasion, diverticula can become inflamed or infected, or they may tear. The inflammation can lead to a more chronic and serious condition known as diverticulitis. Once diverticulitis begins, it may cause serious health problems, including: nausea.
The daily adequate intake amount for fiber has been calculated by the U.S. Institute of Medicine. Men ages 19 and older should strive for 38 grams a day and women ages 19 and older should aim for 25 grams a day. Fiber is in many foods, including beans, peas, other vegetables, fruits, and whole grain products. You can figure out how much fiber is in a food by looking at the nutrition facts label . If a food has fiber, it will be listed under the total carbohydrate on the label. The food label assumes the daily value (DV) of fiber is 25 grams a day (g/day) for a 2,000 calorie diet. Be sure to increase the amount of fiber in your diet slowly so that your stomach can adjust to the change. Adding too much fiber too quickly may cause stomach upset and gas. Some doctors recommend adding bran to your diet to help boost the fiber content. If you do this, start slowly with 1 teaspoon a day.
Actually, no specific foods are known to trigger diverticulitis attacks. And no special diet has been proved to prevent attacks. In the past, people with small pouches in the lining of the colon (diverticula) were told to avoid nuts, seeds and popcorn. It was thought that these foods could lodge in diverticula and cause inflammation (diverticulitis). But there's no evidence that these foods cause diverticulitis. If you're trying to prevent diverticulitis attacks, focus on eating an overall healthy diet that's high in fiber. High-fiber foods, such as fruits, vegetables and whole grains, soften waste and help it pass more quickly through your colon.
If you’ve been diagnosed with diverticulitis, make sure to discuss your food needs and restrictions with your doctor. If you have not yet had that discussion, make a list of food-related questions before your next appointment.
A high-fiber diet is one of the first things a doctor will recommend. That’s because fiber, which is found naturally in healthier foods such as fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, can soften your body’s waste material. Softer stool passes through your intestines and colon more quickly and easily.
Sometimes, especially as they get older, people can develop little bulging pouches in the lining of the large intestine. These are called diverticula, and the condition is known as diverticulosis. When the pouches become inflamed or infected, it leads to a sometimes very painful condition called diverticulitis. In addition to having abdominal pain, people with diverticulitis may experience nausea, vomiting, bloating, fever, constipation, or diarrhea.

Vintages Wine Panel: One of the perfect late spring/early summer wines is Piedmont’s gently sparkling, slightly sweet, low-alcohol Moscato d’Asti. Perfect for those casual afternoon get-togethers on the backyard patio, especially when served with simple seafood nibbles or just-in-season strawberries.
Great producers of Moscato d'Asti include Bera Vittorio, Boro Margliano, Ceretto, Fratelli Barale, La Spinetta, Marchesi di Gresy, Grésy saracco And. Vietti wines from these producers can take some seeking, out but some of them can be found locally At&K l And'beltramo, s ranging in price from$ 12 to$. 20
The light, slightly sweet wines of Moscato d'Asti have found their footing in the past few years. The fragrant aromas of white blossoms and ripe peaches are intoxicating. This lovely wine will always be lower in alcohol and sweeter than the more famous Champagne, but those reasons are why it is so graceful.
Asti Spumante is typically higher in alcohol, sweetness & fizziness, while its higher-class cousin, Mostcato d'Asti, contains lower alcohol levels, a few less bubbles, and a more restrained and delicate representation of Moscato fruit.
Arneis is another grape/wine made in the area, creating a fuller wine that displays some nuttiness in the aroma and taste. Asti is well known for its sparkling wine – in particular Asti Spumante and Moscato d'Asti.

Minerals can be found throughout the world in the earth's crust but usually in such small amounts that they not worth extracting. Only with the help of certain geological processes are minerals concentrated into economically viable deposits. Mineral deposits can only be extracted where they are found. Mineral deposits come in many shapes and sizes depending on where and how the mineral was concentrated. Minerals are concentrated by igneous, sedimentary and metamorphic processes:
In ore beneficiation, flotation is a process in which valuable minerals are separated from worthless material or other valuable minerals by inducing them to gather in and on the surface of a froth layer. Sulfide and non-sulfide minerals as well as native metals are recovered by froth flotation. This process is based on the ability of certain chemicals to modify the surface properties of the mineral(s). Other chemicals are used to generate the froth and still others are used to adjust the pH.
From the land records you can construct a “chain of title.” A chain of title is simply a sequential record of documents showing how the mineral rights have changed hands through the years. Your chain of title will be created using conveyances listed in index books at the courthouse or abstract office.
Beyond that, rocks are fun to study. Some rocks contain beautiful. minerals that are fun to collect, exhibit, and even fashion into jewelry. Others have interesting shapes and colors, or fantastic fossils. There are. few activities that do not, in some way, involve rocks and minerals.
About 80% of all copper extracted comes from sulphide ores. A typical ore contains only 0.5% to 2.0% copper. It is a measure of the value of copper that it is worth extracting it from such small concentrations. The ore is a mixture of minerals and rock (called gangue). Mineral.
The process of froth flotation entails crushing and grinding the ore to a fine size. This fine grinding separates the individual mineral particles from the waste rock and other mineral particles. The grinding is normally done in water with the resultant slurry called the pulp.
Your direct connection to mineral buyers. If you want to know how to find out who owns the mineral rights under your land, or find out if you do, then the first stop in your quest should probably be the county clerk’s office (free) and/or a private abstract office (not free) in the county where your land is located.
How Minerals Are Extracted From Earth. In a previous lesson, we learned about minerals, which are inorganic compounds, such as ores (like copper) and precious stones (like diamonds). The word mining sounds a lot like mineral, and that's no accident because mining is how minerals are removed from the ground. There are several different ways minerals can be extracted from the earth, but the two main methods are called surface mining and subsurface mining.
Scarcity of clean water is one of the most serious global challenges. In its spearhead programme, VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland developed energy-efficient methods for reuse of water in industrial processes and means for recovering valuable minerals and materials from waste for recycling.
The color of the powder is called the. streak, and a simple way to determine it is to rub the mineral. on a small square of white, unglazed porcelain called a streak. plate. Unless the mineral is harder than the porcelain (hard-. ness of about 6), a streak of fine powder is left on the plate. PENNSYLVANIA’S MINERALS.

Answers. 1  the deoxygenated blood returns via the veins to the Right Atrium, then through the tricuspid valve to the Right Ventricle. The Right Ventricle then pumps the blood thru the pulmonary valve, pulmonary arteries and into the lungs, where oxygen is taken up by the red blood cells. The oxygenated blood then returns to the heart via the pulmonary veins and into the left Atrium, thru the mitral valve and into the Left Ventricle. The Left Ventricle pumps the oxygenated blood thru the aortic valve into the aorta and away it goes to the rest of the body .
In a baby with tricuspid atresia with severe pulmonary narrowing, closure of the ductus arteriosus removes the baby’s means of getting blood to the lungs and can result in very low oxygen levels. In this case a medicine called prostaglandin is given to keep the ductus arteriosus from closing.
The right ventricle contracts. The av valves close, semilunar valves open. The deoxygenated blood is pumped into the pulmonary artery. The pulmonary artery carries the blood to the lungs. The blood becomes oxygenated and is returned to the left atrium by the pulmonary veins. Semilunar valves close, av valves open. Pulmonary veins fill the left atrium with blood.
located in the thorax between the lungs, size of your fist, less than 1 lb, pointed apex directed toward left hip, base is broad part on top. Trace the path of a drop of blood, starting at the right atrium and returning to the right atrium, through the pulmonary and systemic circuits of the cardiovascular system. Identify the chambers, valves, and vessels and indicate whether the blood is oxygenated or deoxygenated in each area. Right Atrium-->Tricuspid Valve-->Right Ventricle-->Pulmonary Semilunar Valve-->Pulmonary Artery-->Lungs-->Pulmonary Veins-->Left Atrium-->Bicuspid Valve-->Left Ventricle-->Aortic Semilunar Valve-->Aorta-->Arteries-->Capillaries-->Veins-->Vena Cavas-->Right Atrium
Asker's rating. 1  the deoxygenated blood returns via the veins to the Right Atrium, then through the tricuspid valve to the Right Ventricle. The Right Ventricle then pumps the blood thru the pulmonary valve, pulmonary arteries and into the lungs, where oxygen is taken up by the red blood cells. 2  What Are The Parts Of A Heart. Oxygenated: left atrium, left ventricle; passing through left atrioventricular valve (AKA bicuspid valve, AKA mitral valve) and aortic valve Deoxygenated: right atrium, right ventricle; passing through right atrioventricular valve (AKA tricuspid vavle) and the pulmonary valve.
Indicate whether the other heart chambers are in systole or diastole and whether they are filling or emptying of blood. If they are emptying, state where the blood is going. If they are filling with blood, state where the blood is coming from. Include an explanation of which valves are open and which valves are closed.
The tricuspid valve forms the boundary between the right ventricle and the right atrium. Deoxygenated blood enters the right side of the heart via the inferior and superior vena cava. These are large veins that transport deoxygenated blood from the body back to the heart.
Tricuspid atresia occurs when the tricuspid valve fails to develop while the baby is in the womb. This problem is quite rare, affecting 1 in 15,000 births, and it occurs equally in boys and girls. In the normal heart, the tricuspid valve is located on the heart’s right side between the atria (the upper chamber) and the ventricle (the lower chamber). In babies born with tricuspid atresia, the tricuspid valve is absent (1) and the right ventricle is small (2). In about 25% of babies, the position of the great arteries is also reversed. In some babies, there is also a severe narrowing at the pulmonary valve (3), or there can be complete absence of the pulmonary valve. In all babies with tricuspid atresia, there is no direct pathway for blue blood returning from the body to get to the lungs to pick up oxygen.

There is more meat on this hog if you work at it, but you can get it this far without ever smelling the gut or having to deal with flowing entrails. There are those who eat the heart, liver, and there is a little bit of meat on the ribs and in the hock joints. Knock yourself out. The gators got the rest of this girl.
Allow it to bleed out for a few minutes. Transport the pig to the butchering station. You can drag a smaller pig, but you may need a tractor if the animal weighs more than 200 pounds. Spray the pig with a pressurized water hose or douse it with buckets of water to loosen the mud and debris on the animal's skin.
The panorama. His head is on the right, legs and gambrel are on the left, although none of that is in frame. Our table is 6 feet 2 inches long, the hog stretched out from his rear hooves to the tip of his snout at 6 feet 11 inches and about 5 feet from tail to snout tip.
Just over 35 pounds of fresh meat went into the cooler and the gators feasted on the rest of the hog that night. We also managed to document the basic butchering process of a wild hog. Note that this is a “no saw” method of processing a hog.
Today, more than 4 million. wild hogs are found in at least 35 states. Wild hogs destroy farmland and crops, compete with native wildlife for food, and. can spread disease to other animals and. people. Hunting wild hogs is a popular sport. among hunters, as well as a population. control method supported by wildlife. agencies.
This is a short photo essay on how to butcher a wild hog with Dwayne Powell of Kissimee River Hunt & Fish. Later we will do a bigger animal, but this is the most common size for what is considered a “meat hog.” It is a sow, around 130-150 pounds, taken by one of Dwayne’s guide clients, Larry Hoffner.
Pre-baiting of an area at least a week in advance will help in getting the hogs to return to the area in which the trap is to be set. Set the trap on flat ground and wire the door open. Bait the inside of the trap, leaving a small trail of bait through the door to the outside of the trap to lure the hog inside.
Feral hogs may appear basically the same as domestic hogs and will vary in color and coat pattern. A mature feral hog may reach a shoulder height of 36 inches and weigh from 100 to over 400 pounds. The extreme larger hogs are generally not far removed from domestication. Males are generally larger than females.
Mortality in feral hog populations is greatest in the young less than three months of age, mainly due to accident, starvation and predation. Adult mortality is largely due to hunting, parasites, disease and tooth deterioration. Predation by mountain lions, coyotes and bobcats is only a minor limiting factor.
Decide on the room or location where you will butcher the pig. Set up a table where you'll process individual cuts of meat. Lay your knives on the table. Pour ice and cold water into a large cooler or ice chest to preserve the cuts of meat while you're working. Set up the gambrel and pulley system.

Voter turnout in presidential elections is historically much higher than in midterms– 58.2% of eligible voters voted in 2012, and 61.6% voted in 2008, the highest turnout since 1968. In other words, turnout for Obama’s first presidential election was almost double the 2014 midterm turnout.
The last time voter turnout was that low was 1942, when only 33.9% of voters cast ballots, according to the United States Elections Project. That was also a year that the U.S. established the European Theater of Operations in WWII, so a large share of the voting population was a little busy doing other things.
Last updated: 6/11/2014 National general election voting-eligible population turnout rates for presidential and midterm elections are plotted below, along with the raw data provided in an accompanying spreadsheet. These numbers are taken from Vital Statistics of American Politics (CQ Press, Stanley and Niemi, eds.).

Actually, I don't think Ancient Rome had much in the way of taxes for citizens for a long time. They had a very small property tax on land, wealth slaves, etc. and the provinces were taxed by community I think through some type of tithe system.
Even if it is, on the federal income tax (probably the same in all the states), that sort of deduction is possible only if you file schedule A-B, and that makes sense only if your total of medical expenses and charity is exceptionally large, as you must choose between that and the standard deduction.
Of course, the organization that you are coaching for has to be a registered 501(c)(3) tax-exempt org for these expenses to qualify. And your volunteer expenses will have to exceed 2% of your adjusted gross income to be deductible. Also, the expenses are net of any reimbursements or compensation received for coaching.
I have procrastinated in filing my income tax returns (like always) and find myself looking for more deductions this year. Since the organization I coach for is classified as a charitable organization, I believe I can deduct some of my coaching expenses.
You can deduct qualifying expenses paid in the tax year for: 1  Education during in the year, or. 2  Education that begins during the year, or. 3  Education that begins during the first three months of the following year.

OVERVIEW. The Tuition and Fees Deduction expired at the end of 2014. It allows you to deduct up to $4,000 from your income for qualifying tuition expenses paid for you, your spouse, or your dependents.
If you deduct these expenses under some other provision of the tax code, such as for employee or business expenses, you cannot also deduct the expenses for the Tuition and Fees Deduction.
You cannot take a deduction for: 1  Room and board, optional fees (such as for student health insurance), transportation, or other similar personal expenses. 2  Course-related books and supplies, unless you are required to buy them directly from the school.

However, diagnosing trigeminal neuralgia can be difficult and it can take a few years for a diagnosis to be confirmed. Read more about diagnosing trigeminal neuralgia. What causes trigeminal neuralgia? Trigeminal neuralgia is usually caused by compression of the trigeminal nerve. This is the nerve inside the skull that transmits sensations of pain and touch from your face, teeth and mouth to your brain. The compression of the trigeminal nerve is usually caused by a nearby blood vessel pressing on part of the nerve inside the skull. In rare cases trigeminal neuralgia can be caused by damage to the trigeminal nerve as a result of an underlying condition, such as multiple sclerosis (MS) or a tumour.
Trigeminal neuralgia is a chronic pain disorder that affects the trigeminal nerve. There are two main types: typical and atypical trigeminal neuralgia. The typical form results in episodes of severe, sudden, shock-like pain in one side of the face that lasts for seconds to a few minutes. Groups of these episodes can occur over a few hours. The atypical form results in a constant burning pain that is less severe. Episodes may be triggered by any touch to the face. Both forms may occur in the same

Trigeminal neuralgia. Trigeminal neuralgia (TN or TGN) is a chronic pain disorder that affects the trigeminal nerve. There are two main types: typical and atypical trigeminal neuralgia. The typical form results in episodes of severe, sudden, shock-like pain in one side of the face that lasts for seconds to a few minutes.
Trigeminal neuralgia is sudden, severe facial pain. It's often described as a sharp shooting pain or like having an electric shock in the jaw, teeth or gums. It usually occurs in short, unpredictable attacks that can last from a few seconds to about two minutes. The attacks stop as suddenly as they start.
However, not all people will have the symptoms described above and there are variants of TN. One of which is atypical trigeminal neuralgia (trigeminal neuralgia, type 2 or trigeminal neuralgia with concomitant pain ), based on a recent classification of facial pain.
Living with trigeminal neuralgia can be very difficult. It can have a significant impact on a person's quality of life, resulting in problems such as weight loss, isolation and depression. Read more about the symptoms of trigeminal neuralgia. When to seek medical advice
In most cases trigeminal neuralgia affects part or all of one side of the face, with the pain usually felt in the lower part of the face. Very occasionally it can affect both sides of the face, although not usually at the same time.
One, two, or all three branches of the nerve may be affected. Trigeminal neuralgia most commonly involves the middle branch (the maxillary nerve or V 2) and lower branch (mandibular nerve or V 3) of the trigeminal nerve.
Trigeminal neuralgia causes facial pain. Trigeminal neuralgia develops in mid to late life. The condition is the most frequently occurring of all the nerve pain disorders. The pain, which comes and goes, feels like bursts of sharp, stabbing, electric-shocks. This pain can last from a few seconds to a few minutes.
The major source of amylase in all species is pancreatic secretions, although amylase is also present in saliva of some animals, including humans. Pancreatic juice is composed of two secretory products critical to proper digestion: digestive enzymes and bicarbonate.The enzymes are synthesized and secreted from the exocrine acinar cells, whereas bicarbonate is secreted from the epithelial cells lining small pancreatic ducts.hree major groups of enzymes are critical to efficient digestion: 1. Proteases. Digestion of proteins is initiated by pepsin in the stomach, but the bulk of protein digestion is due to the pancreatic proteases.
1. Proteases Digestion of proteins is initiated by pepsin in the stomach, but the bulk of protein digestion is due to the pancreatic proteases.

Digestion of proteins is initiated by pepsin in the stomach, but the bulk of protein digestion is due to the pancreatic proteases.
Digestive enzymes are secreted by different exocrine glands including: 1  Salivary glands. 2  Secretory cells in the stomach. 3  Secretory cells in the pancreas. 4  Secretory glands in the small intestine. It is produced by the stomach cells called chief cells in its inactive form pepsinogen, which is a zymogen. 2  Pepsinogen is then activated by the stomach acid into its active form, pepsin. 3  Pepsin breaks down the protein in the food into smaller particles, such as peptide fragments and amino acids.

The enzymes that are secreted in the stomach are called gastric enzymes. The stomach plays a major role in digestion, both in a mechanical sense by mixing and crushing the food, and also in an enzymatic sense, by digesting it. It is produced by the stomach cells called chief cells in its inactive form pepsinogen, which is a zymogen. 2  Pepsinogen is then activated by the stomach acid into its active form, pepsin. 3  Pepsin breaks down the protein in the food into smaller particles, such as peptide fragments and amino acids.
1 Gastrin: This hormone, which is very similar to cholecystokinin, is secreted in large amounts by the stomach in response to gastric distention and irritation. 2  In addition to stimulating acid secretion by the parietal cell, gastrin stimulates pancreatic acinar cells to secrete digestive enzymes.s you might expect, secretion from the exocrine pancreas is regulated by both neural and endocrine controls. During interdigestive periods, very little secretion takes place, but as food enters the stomach and, a little later, chyme flows into the small intestine, pancreatic secretion is strongly stimulated.

Secretion. The stomach produces and secretes several important substances to control the digestion of food. Each of these substances is produced by exocrine or endocrine cells found in the mucosa. 1  The main exocrine product of the stomach is gastric juice – a mixture of mucus, hydrochloric acid, and digestive enzymes.he stomach produces and secretes several important substances to control the digestion of food.

U could probably do it in like 2-3 hours. It would be terrible and include little research, but I could do it. If I wanted to make it an actual solid paper with research and shit it'd be more like 8 or so hours probably. Depends on the kind of paper, topic and how much time I have to complete it.
It has to be 250-500 words. The 1-2 page limit is probably double-spaced. Remember college adcoms only have like, a minute with the essay. I have a feeling an essay that exceeds the limit by more than 200% would annoy adcoms immensely.

The best way to treat maggot wound is to apply ivermectin injection and betadine powder on the wound, give 1 ml injection to the dog. You will see the maggot will come out or die within hours and wound will heal in 3 to 4 days.
Treating Wound in Small Animal With Maggot. I have experienced a way to get rid of maggots. First was a stray cat with its ear bitten and serum dripping wound and maggot infested, and foul smelling. I searched the net for an answer. I found the only way was to put the animal to rest. Once infested with maggots, the net material said it was living death.
Myiasis is a the term used to describe a maggot infestation. Maggots are fly larva that feed on necrotic and dying tissue. Especially prone are those pets confined to the outdoors with situations in which their skin remains moist. This includes pets with draining wounds, urine or fecal stained hair coats, or bacterial skin infections.
Clean the trash can with a mixture of water and vinegar to remove any odors and repel flies. Flies leave larvae that grow into maggots. Thoroughly dry out the trash can after cleaning, as maggots thrive in moist environments. Bay leaves and mint oil are known to repel flies. Place a few bay leaves in the trash bag and spray the outside of the trash can with mint oil to help keep maggots away.
Diagnosis of myiasis is based on visualizing the maggots on the skin or in the wounds. Fly eggs can sometimes be found. Eggs (also called fly blow) are small white and sticky. They usually can only be removed by shaving the hair.
Discourage and prevent flies from hanging around to prevent maggot infestations. When flies find a hospitable place to hang out, such as a garbage bin, they lay eggs that hatch into maggots. While keeping garbage covered and unattractive to flies can help prevent the problem, you still need to eradicate any maggots that have appeared. But don't reach for a bug bomb; simple table salt is an inexpensive and easy solution.
A wound of the size of a pinhole may be enough for a fly to get attracted and lay eggs on. In areas the animal can reach with his tongue, these fly eggs are usually licked off. Danger areas for an animal where maggot infestations are common are the ears, anywhere on the head and neck, back of the body, anus.
REMOVING DEAD MAGGOTS: Check the wound to see if the maggots show signs of life. Even when you think you have removed all the maggots, inspect the inside of the wound thoroughly with a torch. Maggots often create tiny tunnels leading from the main wound deeper into the body of the dog.
Maggots are fly larvae, and they can be hard to eliminate. Whether they have infested your trash can, your home or you have somehow managed to have them as part of an infection on your body (myiasis), you need to know how to kill maggots in order to successfully get rid of these creatures. Household Solutions.
There are few things more upsetting than a maggot infection, but you likely have the tools you need to get rid of them already lying around your house: 1  If you have dog shampoo, you can make a permithrin solution to kill maggots. 2  If you have bleach, you can use it as a cheap and effective maggot killer.

This change of state from a gas to a solid is not a very common phase change but is referred to as deposition. It is called deposition because the particles in the gas form are depositing into a solid form. Examples of Gas to Solid: 1. Making dry ice or solid carbon dioxide involves the removal of gaseous carbon dioxide from air and using cold temperatures and higher pressure causes the gas particles to skip the liquid phase and deposit into a solid to form a chunk of dry ice. 2.

Abstract. 1  Gibbons are small arboreal apes inhabiting the rainforests of South-East Asia, Northwest India and Bangladesh (Carpenter 1940; Chivers 1977). The taxonomy of gibbons is under dispute, as the status of several taxa as species or subspecies is uncertain. Within the family Hylobatideae, there are four genera of gibbons: Bunopithecus (hoolock gibbon), Hylobates, Nomascus (crested gibbons) and Symphalangus (siamangs), and at least 12 species (Brandon-Jones et al. 2004).
CHAPTER TWELVE Primate Biogeography and Ecology on the Sunda Shelf Islands: A Paleontological and Zooarchaeological Perspective Terry Harrison, John Krigbaum, and Jessica Manser ABSTRACT Sundaland, with its complicated history of island formation and landbridge connections with mainland Southeast Asia, has figured prominently in studies of primate biogeog- raphy.
Kloss's gibbon range Kloss's gibbon (Hylobates klossii), also known as the Mentawai gibbon or the bilou, is an endangered primate in the gibbon family, Hylobatidae. It is identifiable in that it is all black, resembling the Siamang with its black fur, but is considerably smaller and lacks the Siamang's distinctive throat pouch.
While small gibbons are allopatric, the siamang is sympatric with two small hylobatid species, agile gibbons on the island of Sumatra and white-handed gibbons in northern Sumatra and the Malaysian peninsula, Indonesia.
Population sizes of several gibbon species have not been estimated since the early 1980ís or are data deficient.î Whereas research on, and conservation activities directed at, the great apes are supported by a strong lobby, gibbons tend to be overlooked whenever media, scientists, funding agencies and conservation agencies are referring to apes.

Penta means five and dactyl means digit in Greek. Almost all primates have 5 fingers on their hands and five toes on their feet. This is an ancient trait found among our early mammal and reptile ancestors.
The siamang (Symphalangus syndactylus) is an arboreal black-furred gibbon native to the forests of Malaysia , Thailand , and Sumatra . The largest of the gibbons, the siamang can be twice the size of other gibbons, reaching 1 m in height, and weighing up to 14 kg. The siamang is the only species in the genus Symphalangus .
Great apes diversified during the Miocene in Old World forests. Two lineages, gorillas in Africa and orangutans in Asia, have sexual dimorphisms of super-sized males, though they presumably diverged from a smaller common ancestor.
Gibbons and siamangs are rare at archaeological or paleontological sites on the Sunda islands. Their underrepresentation at archaeological sites may be Sunda Shelf Primate Biogeography 355 associated with the difficulty that humans experienced in hunting them prior to the advent of projectile point technologies in the Late Pleistocene (see Harrison 1996, 1998, 2000).

Product lifecycle management (PLM) software manages data during the development of a product from inception through the manufacturing, servicing, and disposal processes. Companies use PLM software to increase productivity and collaboration, improve quality, bolster creativity, and shorten time to market for a product.
Recently, Razorleaf was asked to develop a proposal that would deliver PLM as a managed service, kind of like SaaS (Software-as-a-Service). One way to offer PLM as a managed service is pure SaaS (like Arena Solutions). If you’re not familiar with Arena, think of SalesForce.com or Gmail. Another way to offer PLM as a managed service is to take traditional PLM software and host it in an off-premise environment where it can be managed by a third party.
Nervous tissue is the main component of the two parts of the nervous system; the brain and spinal cord of the central nervous system (CNS), and the branching peripheral nerves of the peripheral nervous system (PNS), which regulates and controls bodily functions and activity.n the central nervous system (CNS), the tissue types found are grey matter and white matter. In the peripheral nervous system (PNS), the tissue types are nerves and ganglia. The tissue is categorized by its neuronal and neuroglial components.
Nerve Tissue. Although the nervous system is very complex, there are only two main types of cells in nerve tissue. The actual nerve cell is the neuron. It is the conducting cell that transmits impulses and the structural unit of the nervous system. The other type of cell is neuroglia, or glial, cell.eurons, or nerve cells, carry out the functions of the nervous system by conducting nerve impulses. They are highly specialized and amitotic. This means that if a neuron is destroyed, it cannot be replaced because neurons do not go through mitosis.
NERVOUS TISSUE. Nervous tissue is the fourth basic tissue type of the body and is organized into two basic systems: (1) the Central Nervous System (CNS) and (2) the Peripheral Nervous System (PNS).The peripheral system responds to stimuli and sends impulses to the central system (brain and spinal cord).ERVOUS TISSUE.

The nervous system is a complex collection of nerves and specialized cells known as neurons that transmit signals between different parts of the body.It is essentially the body’s electrical wiring. Structurally, the nervous system has two components: the central nervous system and the peripheral nervous system.he nervous system is a complex collection of nerves and specialized cells known as neurons that transmit signals between different parts of the body.
The cells in nervous tissue that generate and conduct impulses are called neurons or nerve cells. These cells have three principal parts: the dendrites, the cell body, and one axon. The main part of the cell, the part that carries on the general functions, is the cell body.ervous tissue also includes cells that do not transmit impulses, but instead support the activities of the neurons. These are the glial cells (neuroglial cells), together termed the neuroglia. Supporting, or glia, cells bind neurons together and insulate the neurons.
Nervous Tissue. Nervous tissue consists of nerve cells and associated supporting cells. All cells exhibit electrical properties, but nerve cells, also called neurons, are specifically designed to transmit electrical impulses from one site in the body to another, and to receive and process information.he nervous system is divided into the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS). The central nervous system is limited to the brain and spinal cord, all other nervous tissue belongs to the peripheral nervous system.

That means women needed to stay home and care for children). Hippies largely came in during the '60s with the folk rock protest movement. There were Newport concerts in '63 with Bob Dylan, Joan Baez, Peter, Paul, and Mary, and other bands like that. In the '60s, hippies were for free love, much like the Beat generation was.
A couple of weeks ago, I tie-dyed t-shirts with my son as an afternoon time-killer. We had a lot of fun doing it because it was easy (no seriously — it really was) and the shirts came out great! These were not the mediocre, faded Rit dye type of shirts I made in high school and college.

Step 5: Rinse your shirt and untie it. After the dyes have set up over night (or for 6-8 hours), rinse the shirt until the water runs clear. Then, it’s time for the big reveal! Pull the rubber bands off your shirt and shake it out to see your design.
The 50's was more like the greaser look. rockabilly and psychobilly girls. The pin up look. Polkadot dresses and girls would wear a lot of hairspray. tie dye is in the 60's/70's. neon was in the 80's.
Step 1: Step 1: Before tie-dying, you will need to set up your work space.To keep mess to a minumum, cover work area with disposable plastic table cloth or garbage bags. Step 2: Step 2: Fill plastic squeeze bottles with fabric dye and water (follow specific directions on box). Step 3: Step 3: To prepare the shirts for dying, tie rubber bands around each t-shirt and dip each shirt in salt water. Step 4: Step 4: With plastic gloves on for skin protection, squeeze desired plastic squeeze bottles with dye onto the t-shirt.
I’m going to show you how to use this kit in this tutorial, so if you opt for a different set of materials, follow the instructions for those dyes. This kit said that it dyed “up to 8 shirts” but I only had enough dye for six shirts — one adult sized and 5 kid sized. I had to really stretch to get that 6th shirt dyed too, so I probably shouldn’t really count it in the total.
In the early '70s, young people copied the hippie looks but were not really hippies. This trend peaked by '75, but then the hippie culture started to die out with the Viet Nam war. Neon colors were worn in the late '70s and '80s. '80s had flashy clothes and preppy clothes (Think J Crew to the max).

Today, geography is commonly divided into two major branches-cultural geography (also called human geography) and physical geography. Cultural geography is the branch of geography dealing with human culture and its impact on the Earth.f course, geography today means much more than writing about the Earth but it's a difficult discipline to define. Many geographers have done their best to define geography but a typical dictionary definition today reads, The science of the Earth's physical features, resources, climate, population, etc..

US Department of Labor. U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The Injuries, Illnesses, and Fatalities (IIF) program provides annual information on the rate and number of work-related injuries, illnesses, and fatal injuries, and how these statistics vary by incident, industry, geography, occupation, and other characteristics.
OSHA-specific statistics on data and time-series information is monitored through the OSHA Office of Statistics; fatalities in Federal states are compiled by the OSHA Directorate of Enforcement Programs; and fatalities in State Plan states are compiled by the OSHA Directorate of Cooperative and State Programs.
Rate Calculation: An incidence rate of injuries and illnesses is computed from the following formula: (Number of injuries and illnesses X 200,000) / Employee hours worked = Incidence rate. The TCR includes all cases recorded on the OSHA Form 300 (Column G + Column H + Column I + Column J).
Information contained on this site which is specific to OSHA-related labor statistics can be answered through OSHA. All other labor statistics questions and or comments should be addressed through the Bureau of Labor Statistics (http://www.bls.gov/iif/).
The two approaches do this in slightly different ways. Published HSE injury rates give the number of people injured over a year in a group of 100,000 employees. or workers. The frequency rate is the number of people injured over a year for each million1 hours worked by. a group of employees or workers.
* Source material, data, and tables are provided by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Department of Labor, and OSHA's Area Offices.
Safeopedia explains Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (LTIFR) The lost time injury frequency rate (LTIFR) is calculated using two pieces of essential information: the LTI within a given time frame, and the amount of hours worked in that time frame. The other element of the equation is the standardized rate, that is to say, there are X number of LTIs per a set amount of time.
Total number of non-fatal work-related injury and illness cases. [where to find this number] Number of cases involving days away from work. [where to find this number] Number of cases involving job transfer or restricted work activity only. [where to find this number]
Lost time injury frequency rate (LTIFR) refers to the amount or number of lost time injuries, that is, injuries that occurred in the workplace that resulted in an employee's inability to work the next full work day, which occurred in a given period relative to the total number oh hours worked in the accounting period.
Establishment Specific Injury & Illness Data (OSHA Data Initiative) The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) collected work-related injury and illness data from employers within specific industry and employment size specifications from 1996 through 2011. This data collection is called the OSHA Data Initiative or ODI.
When we wrote last week that the Toyota Mirai hydrogen fuel-cell sedan was little-changed for the 2017 model year, with only one new color added, we missed one important element. That was, as several readers informed us, that while the retail price remained the same, the monthly lease cost had fallen sharply: from $499 to $349 per month.
All factual information posted should be true, and if you are an employee of a company in the hydrogen industry, or have a financial interest or other material connection relevant to the discussion, you must make this known this each time you post.
Toyota Mirai To Cost Under $45,000 With Incentives in the US. Yesterday we were telling you the Toyota FCV production version will enter the market under the “Mirai” name and will reach dealerships, in California at least, in fall 2015. Now it’s time to find out some specs and, more importantly, the price tag it will wear.
So we’re sharing our patents, to encourage other car companies and energy companies who believe in clean, alternative energy to help bring hydrogen to the world. Every innovation marks a turning point in the hydrogen movement and a step towards a more sustainable future.
More Photos. Toyota intends to introduce a smaller, less-expensive model in the Mirai hydrogen fuel cell family in time for the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo, the Asahi Shimbun reports. The new model will reportedly hit the road in 2019 at a cost of 5.5 million to 6.0 million yen ($50,600 to $55,200 US at current exchange rates).
You’ll be able to lease the Mirai at $499 per month on a 36 month period with $3,649 due at lease signing. Or you can purchase the car straight away for $57,500. And if you meet the conditions for state and federal incentives ($13,000), the Mirai’s price can drop under $45,000.
DON'T MISS: 2017 Toyota Mirai price stays same, fuel-cell car adds new color. And that lower lease cost contributed to what can only be described as a remarkable sales spike for the Mirai last month. From January through July, the Mirai sold at a rate of about 40 a month, logging a total of 270 sales over seven months.
ALSO SEE: Toyota Mirai: First Drive Of Hydrogen Fuel-Cell Sedan (Dec 2014) The cut in the monthly lease cost was noted by industry trade journal Ward's Auto, which quoted Bill Fay, Toyota's group vice president, on the reasons for the reduction.

Mirai’s cost and exaggerated eco-friendliness. The Mirai is about the size of the mid-sized Toyota Camry and, with a cost of $57,500, it’s more expensive than any other car in Toyota’s lineup. (Only Toyota’s top-of-the-line SUVs and pickup trucks cost more.) That’s nearly $15,000 more than Toyota’s current best sedan, the Avalon Hybrid, which comes in at about $43,000. Yet due to the space taken up by the hydrogen fuel cell technology used to power the vehicle, the Mirai’s trunk is smaller.

The Federalist Papers provided background and justification for the Constitution. Some states agreed to ratify the Constitution only if the amendments that were to become the Bill of Rights would be taken up immediately by the new government, and they were duly proposed in the first session of the First Congress.
The potential for an opponent to rally voters against a candidate were too strong, not to support the amendment. o This amendment is the reason why eighteen year olds and seventeen year olds who will be eighteen by the date of the next General Election are eligible to vote.
The old Congress set the rules the new government followed in terms of writing and ratifying the new constitution. After ratification in eleven states, in 1789 its elected officers of government assembled in New York City, replacing the Articles of Confederation government.
Reasons to Vote So you can decide. Why let other people decide what is best for you when you have a voice: the vote. It's your right. Young people, women and underrepresented groups all fought hard for the right to vote.
The Articles of Confederation was unanimously adopted in 1781 once Maryland agreed. Over the previous four years, it had been used by Congress as a working document to administer the early United States government, win the Revolutionary War and secure the Treaty of Paris (1783) with Great Britain.
Representation in Congress should be both by states and by population. There, he was voted down by the small states in favor of all states equal, one vote only. Now in 1787 Convention, he wanted to balance all the big-state victories for population apportionment.
Since the beginning of federal operations under the Constitution in 1789 through the beginning of 2013, approximately 11,539 proposals to amend the Constitution have been introduced in the United States Congress. Of these, thirty-three have been approved by Congress and sent to the states for ratification.

get healthy living updates. Either run for your life or face the top 10 most feared predators of the animal kingdom. 10. Tarantula. Tarantula spiders are among the most feared animals on the planet, and with good reason.
The Yautja, known colloquially as the Predators, are an extraterrestrial species characterized by their hunting of other dangerous species for sport and honor, including humans.
1 Predators (soundtrack) — The soundtrack to the film by John Debney. 2  Predators: Beating the Bullet — A comic book adaptation of the film. 3  Predators (video game) — The first of two mobile games based on the film. 4  Predators (Gameloft) — The second mobile game based on the film.
He also states that the Predators always come in groups of three and that there is a blood-feud occurring between two different tribes of Predator — the black tribe, who are now hunting Royce and the others, and the classic form of Predators seen in other films, one of which they found tied up at the Predator camp.
Followed by. Predators is a 2010 science fiction film directed by Nimrod Nimród antal and Starring Adrien, Brody Topher, Grace Alice, Braga Walton goggins And Laurence. fishburne
Predators are bipedal humanoids, physically distinguishable from humans by their greater height, the long, hair-like appendages on their heads (nicknamed dreadlocks), their reptilian skin and their faces, which feature arthropod-like mandibles and no visible nose.
According to some reports, yautja motivations for hunting are not just for sport, but rather for honor, with the species having developed a whole tribal culture around their status at the top of the food chain, as the ultimate Predator.
However, the film avoids any mention of the Alien franchise and ignores the Alien vs. Predator series completely. The title Predators is intended to have a double meaning, in that it refers to both the film's alien creatures, as well as the group of humans that are hunted by them.
Thanks for the info. I have to agree that the most alarming predators are the ones that lurk under water! The black mamba and the wolf were beautiful. The picture of the Komodo dragon just made me laugh (which I'm sure would not be my response if I ever met one!).
Combat between yautja is generally not permitted as the focus of their species is to kill and hunt other life forms. Certain Predator clans have been known to take unorthodox approaches such as accepting humans into their clans.

Values of less than 200 pg/mL are a sign of a vitamin B12 deficiency. People with this deficiency are likely to have or develop symptoms. Older adults with vitamin B12 levels between 200 and 500 pg/mL may also have symptoms.
As often as possible, your daily B12 intake should be through a well-rounded diet of B12-containing foods. Recommended B12 amounts for adults are 2.4 micrograms per day and recommended amounts for children range from .9 to 1.8 micrograms per day. Recommended amounts for infants range from .4 to .5 micrograms per day.
If your blood values for the vitamin fall below a range of 170 to 250 picograms per milliliter, you may develop a B12 deficiency.
Vitamin B12 Blood Levels Range and Test Results. Normal values of vitamin B12 in blood are between 200 to 900 picograms per milileter. Talk to your lab and request the specific values since every lab values ‘normal range’ differently.
The parietal peritoneum lines the abdominal wall and extends to the organs, whereas the visceral peritoneum covers the organs. The peritoneal cavity lies between these two peritoneal layers. It contains a thin layer of fluid that lubricates the peritoneal surfaces.
Peritoneum. The peritoneum is a smooth, glistening, serous membrane that lines the abdominal wall as the parietal peritoneum and is reflected from the body wall to various organs, where, as visceral peritoneum, it forms an integral part as the outermost, or serosal, layer.
The visceral peritoneum encapsulates the individual abdominal organs and is supplied by the organ it is closest to. The peritoneal cavity is a theoretical space that exists between the two layers of the peritoneal mesothelium.

The parietal peritoneum lines the abdominal wall and extends to the organs, whereas the visceral peritoneum covers the organs. The peritoneal cavity lies between these two peritoneal layers.
The parietal peritoneum covers the internal abdominal walls and is supplied by the regional neurovasculature. The visceral peritoneum encapsulates the individual abdominal organs and is supplied by the organ it is closest to.
Although ultimately one continuous sheet, two types of peritoneum are referenced: 1  Parietal peritoneum is that portion that lines the abdominal and pelvic cavities. 2  Visceral peritoneum covers the external surfaces of most abdominal organs, including the intestinal tract.
The peritoneum is a layer of serous membrane that constitutes the inner lining of the abdominopelvic cavity. This article will highlight the main anatomical features of the peritoneum and its subdivisions, the omenta, the mesenteries, the peritoneal ligaments and the epiploic foramen.
Its visceral branches provide blood to organs, while its parietal branches supply blood to the tissues of the abdominal body wall. 1  The inferior phrenic artery is a parietal artery, the most superior branch of the abdominal aorta.
The peritoneum helps support the organs in the abdominal cavity and also allows nerves, blood vessels, and lymph vessels to pass through to the organs. The parietal peritoneum lines the abdominal wall and extends to the organs, whereas the visceral peritoneum covers the organs.
1 Treatment of broken fingers depends on the type of fracture and the particular bone in the finger that is injured. Surgery may be required for fractures causing significant deformity or involving a joint.  Complications of a broken finger can include join stiffness, rotation, nonunion, and infection.
1 Complications of a broken finger can include join stiffness, rotation, nonunion, and infection.  After reduction, immobilization, and four to six weeks of healing, the prognosis for healing is excellent for a broken finger.
1 Take a long thin item, as long as your broken finger, such as a popsicle stick or a pen. 2  Place it next to your broken finger, or have a friend or family member help you hold it in place.  Use medical tape to wrap together the stick or pen and your finger. Wrap it loosely.
1 In some cases, your doctor may strap your broken finger to the finger next to it, known as buddy taping. The splint will hold your finger in position as it heals.  Your doctor may also move the bone back into place, a procedure known as reduction.
1 Surgery may be required for fractures causing significant deformity or involving a joint. 2  Complications of a broken finger can include join stiffness, rotation, nonunion, and infection.  After reduction, immobilization, and four to six weeks of healing, the prognosis for healing is excellent for a broken finger.
1 If the trauma is severe, broken bones may be exposed through the soft tissues (called a compound fracture).  If pain or swelling limits the motion or use of the fingers, if the finger becomes numb, or if the injury includes a laceration, crushed tissue, or exposure of bone, seek medical care.

In brief: Splint or Surgery. A broken finger may be splinted or the break may require surgery with pins or a plate and screws to provide the best chance for optimal healing and function. Consult with a hand surgeon. A broken finger may be splinted or the break may require surgery with pins or a plate and screws to provide the best chance for optimal healing and function.
Fingertip Injuries and Amputations. Fingertip injuries can occur in accidents at home, work, or play. An injury can involve a sharp cut, a crushing injury, a tearing injury, or a combination of these injury types. An amputation can result from slamming your finger in a car door or catching your ring on a hook or nail. An injury or amputation can damage any part of the fingertip, including the: Skin and soft tissue.
To make a splint: 1  Take a long thin item, as long as your broken finger, such as a popsicle stick or a pen. 2  Place it next to your broken finger, or have a friend or family member help you hold it in place.  Use medical tape to wrap together the stick or pen and your finger. Wrap it loosely.
When a fence is more than 650 feet between corner posts, put braced-line post assemblies every 650 feet in the fence line. A braced line assembly is the same as a single-span braced corner except that a second diagonal brace wire is used to take fence pull in the opposite direction.
In general, the spacing between wires. gets wider as the fence gets taller. Woven wire is available in many combinations. of wire sizes and spacings, as well as a number of. horizontal line wires and fence heights.
Fencing Materials and Equipment ............................................................................ 10. Fence Posts..............................................................................................................................................
Post diameter depends on the strength of the fence. Gerrish says the lightest-duty fence, such as a 1- or 2-wire, high-tensile pasture subdivision fence, only requires a 4- to 5-inch-diameter post. A 5-strand barbed wire fence, or 5- or 6-strand high-tensile wire fence, requires a 6- to 7-inch-diameter post.
Standard distance between 4x4's for Fence? We're about ready to start a FENCE build. We're going to dig 2' deep fence post holes and set them with Fence Post 'cement'. But were curious whether there is a standard that shold be used for the distance BETWEEN each Fence Post? This is a relatively flat yard that we're building this fence for.
On Gerrish's 2-wire range fences, the top wire is at 30 inches and the second wire is at 20 inches. It’s designed to allow antelope to go under the wires at a dead run, but low enough that elk will hit the fence with their legs and not the heaviest part of their body.
Fencers tend to use too many posts, which likely stems from people's experience with barbed wire, where the rule of thumb was 1 post every rod length (16.5 feet). How to fix it: In an electric-fencing system, Derynck reccomends fence post spacing 80-100 feet apart, or about 50 posts per mile. He suggests using a “stay” – a shorter post that sits on top of the ground and holds wires up – if posts are spaced 100 ft. apart.
Locate line posts 15 to 20 feet apart. Use the 15-foot spacing for steel posts or wooden posts with less than 3-1/2-inch diameter tops. Posts may be driven or set with either power or hand tools. If you have more than a few hundred feet of fence to build, use a power driver or auger. Line posts should be set or driven to a minimum depth of 2-1/2 feet. Steel line posts must be oriented for proper wire placement when installed.

All of us, at some point of time, have studied geography. But remembering all the geography terms is next to impossible. Geographical terms such as acid rain, barometer, atmosphere, climate, and weather are used in our day-to-day lives for purposes such as academic projects or making travel plans. Many a time, these geography terms are misunderstood.
Scientists generally divide our little blue world into four separate yet overlapping spheres. These spheres are the lithosphere, the atmosphere, the biosphere, and the hydrosphere. Each of these spheres consist of unique properties that separate them from the others. However, as I am sure you have noticed, there is no distinct boundary or border between them. The atmosphere extends downward into the soil, into caves and rocks, and even into water.

BREAKING DOWN 'Inflation' As a result of inflation, the purchasing power of a unit of currency falls. For example, if the inflation rate is 2%, then a pack of gum that costs $1 in a given year will cost $1.02 the next year. As goods and services require more money to purchase, the implicit value of that money falls. The Federal Reserve uses core inflation data, which excludes volatile industries such as food and energy prices.
Inflation is one of the primary reasons that people invest in the first place. Just as the pack of gum that costs a dollar will cost $1.02 in a year, assuming 2% inflation, a savings account that was worth $1,000 would be worth $903.92 after 5 years, and $817.07 after 10 years, assuming that you earn no interest on the deposit.

Leg pain is a prime example of this. Most people struggle to understand how and why leg pain can be caused by anxiety, but the reality is that the connection is very real, and while it doesn't affect everyone, there are many people living with leg pain right now that is caused by anxiety.
As long as you can relieve your anxiety, the leg pain should go away. Don't forget that anxiety can affect your body in strange ways. Even when you're not feeling any anxious thoughts, or any other anxiety symptoms, it's possible for your anxiety to cause physical symptoms.
Not all leg pain derived from low back problems presents the same way. Leg pain caused by a low back problem is often accompanied by additional symptoms, such as leg numbness or weakness, or foot pain, and the type of leg pain experienced may vary widely from patient to patient.
1 This type of burning pain is fairly typical when a nerve root in the lower spine is irritated, and it is often referred to as sciatica. 2  See Sciatic Nerve and Sciatica. 3  Leg numbness or tingling.
1 Veins return blood from the legs to the heart. 2  There are two systems of veins in the leg: superficial and deep. 3  If a blood clot occurs in a deep vein (deep venous thrombosis), it causes a damming effect, and blood is trapped behind the blockage. 4  This causes redness, swelling, warmth, and pain in the affected area.

1 Blood clot: A blood clot can completely obstruct one of the arteries to the leg and cause the acute onset of pain because the blood supply has been completely cut off. 2  Aside from pain, the leg becomes cool and pale. 3  While there are many potential sources of a blood clot, one common place to look is the heart.
1 Blood clots can also obstruct veins, causing pain. 2  Veins return blood from the legs to the heart. 3  There are two systems of veins in the leg: superficial and deep. 4  If a blood clot occurs in a deep vein (deep venous thrombosis), it causes a damming effect, and blood is trapped behind the blockage.
When your leg pain is caused by anxiety, there is no danger to your health. Despite how scary it may feel when you're suffering from serious pain, anxiety related leg pain is merely a response to the way your body is experiencing stress.
Leg pain often starts as a problem in the lumbar spine, or low back. Watch: Sciatic Nerve Anatomy Video. Leg pain may be caused by a problem in the leg, but often it starts with a problem in the lower back, where the sciatic nerve originates, and then travels along the path of the nerve (called sciatica). 1  See What You Need to Know About Sciatica.
Chest pain that accompanies frequent heartburn can be treated with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). A PPI is a type of medication that reduces acid production in your stomach. Your doctor also may recommend cutting out certain types of food that can trigger symptoms, such as fried foods, spicy foods, and citrus fruits.
For example, it is very possible to feel some pain in the right ribs if you have heartburn. Heartburn is caused by hyperacidity in the stomach. If this happens, then you may also have the initial stages of ulcers and GERD or acid reflux. Of course, there is no telling that you have them unless diagnosed by the doctor.
The symptoms of acid reflux, including chest pain and heartburn, may ease considerably as you straighten your body to a sitting or standing position. Bending and lying down can make GERD symptoms and discomfort worse, particularly right after eating. Cardiac chest pain continues to hurt, regardless your body position. However, it can also come and go throughout the day, depending on the severity of angina.
For example, the pancreas and liver may induce pain in the lower part of the right rib cage. If there are diseases in these organs, you may feel tenderness and pain in the nearby rib areas. It is important that you seek medical assistance if you feel other symptoms like nausea, vomiting, headaches, and extreme pain.
Sorry for your pain. I too suffer from this pain. I have acid reflux and I take nexium for that. I had/have pain in the right quadrant area which also wraps around the back and up to the shoulder blade sometimes.
Still, acid reflux and heartburn could deliver pain in the ribcage and the chest. On the other hand, a disease or damage in the spleen may also result to rib pain in the left side of the body. This is where the spleen is located.
For me it became obvious when I took more omeprazole and the rib pain increased. Decrease omeprazole and the bone pain decreased. However altering the dose (up or down) can trigger the pain and therefore reducing the dose can also cause bone pain whilst mineralisation takes place in the bones.
Re: Questions rib pain. I had the same thing. No gerd, it was H.Pylori. I took the breath test and it was positive. I picked up a bottle of mastic gum and after a month, my breath test came back neg. No more rib pain. I also had a lot of burping that went away with the mastic gum.
Causes of Left Rib Cage Pain. On the other hand, a left side pain in the ribcage could be due to heart problems. The heart is somewhat lying away to the left side of the chest. Therefore, if there are heart diseases or even heart attack a person may feel the initial stages of ribcage pain towards the left of the chest.
Esophageal spasms are the constriction of the muscles around the food tube. They occur when acid reflux or other medical issues cause damage within the esophagus. In turn, these spasms can cause pain in your throat and the upper area of your chest as well.
Home Remedies for Mouth Ulcers. Mouth ulcers are quite common and irritating. These painful, open sores are white in color, surrounded by an inflamed red border. More often than not, they appear on the inside of the cheeks, lips, under the tongue, and on the floor of the mouth.
Swish your mouth with warm water or salt water to get the area clean, allowing the clove oil to really sink in and do its job. Mix the clove oil with the olive oil and then soak a cotton ball in it. Apply the cotton ball directly to the sore for 5-8 minutes for numbing relief.
A cold sore often begins as several tiny blisters that eventually form one larger sore. They appear most often on the lips and face. In contrast, canker sores usually travel alone. And unlike a sore caused by the herpes virus, a canker sore is not contagious. A canker sore has a yellow or white-gray center with a well-defined red border.
It used widely in the culinary world, and has also been prevalent in homeopathic medicine and home remedies for years. Native American’s used sage long before modern medicine to help cleanse the mouth, and to heal the painful ulcers that we now know as canker sores. You will need….

Canker sores are small, shallow ulcers that appear in the mouth and often make eating and talking uncomfortable. There are two types of canker sores: Simple canker sores. These may appear three or four times a year and last up to a week. They typically occur in people ages 10 to 20. Complex canker sores.
Fever, also known as pyrexia and febrile response, is defined as having a temperature above the normal range due to an increase in the body's temperature set-point.There is not a single agreed upon upper limit for normal temperature with sources using values between 37.5 and 38.3 °C (99.5 and 100.9 °F).ever is one of the most common medical signs. It is part of about 30% of healthcare visits by children and occurs in up to 75% of adults who are seriously sick. While fever is a useful defense mechanism, treating fever does not appear to worsen outcomes.

Frequently Asked Questions on Gift Taxes. Below are some of the more common questions and answers about Gift Tax issues. You may also find additional information in Publication 559 or some of the other forms and publications offered on our Forms Page. Included in this area are the instructions to Forms 706 and 709.
The annual exclusion applies to gifts to each donee. In other words, if you give each of your children $11,000 in 2002-2005, $12,000 in 2006-2008, $13,000 in 2009-2012 and $14,000 on or after January 1, 2013, the annual exclusion applies to each gift. The annual exclusion for 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017 is $14,000.
The annual exclusion exempts from gift tax those gifts made to a person in a given calendar year provided that the gift is less than $14,000. This means that you can give up to $14,000 to as many people as you want without triggering the requirement of filing a gift tax return or paying any gift tax.
If you give people a lot of money or property, you might have to pay a federal gift tax. But most gifts are not subject to the gift tax. For instance, you can give up to the annual exclusion amount ($14,000 in 2016) to any number of people every year, without facing any gift taxes.
By: Judith Lohman, Assistant Director. You asked for the estate and inheritance tax rates in Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, and Rhode Island. The information in this report comes from CCH's State Tax Guide and each state's tax department website.
Both Connecticut's tax brackets and the associated tax rates were last changed one year prior to 2015 in 2014. Connecticut has seven marginal tax brackets, ranging from 3% (the lowest Connecticut tax bracket) to 6.99% (the highest Connecticut tax bracket). Each marginal rate only applies to earnings within the applicable marginal tax bracket .
The bad news – the person who gives the gift pays the tax. The good news – the government gives each person a credit to pay their gift and estate tax. In 2017, each person has enough federal credit to pay for gifts totaling $5,490,000 and Connecticut credit to pay for the tax for taxable gifts totaling $2,000,000.
Such a person can give away their entire estate (not that I would recommend it) because their $2.0 million gift tax credit would fully protect the gift from any gift tax. Remember, the credit is applied to the gift and estate tax. This means that you get one credit to either. 1) shield large gifts from gift tax or.
Connecticut's estate tax is the only one of the five with rates not linked to the pre-EGTRRA federal credit rates. Connecticut's rates and brackets are shown in Table 2. Connecticut's taxable estate threshold is $2 million effective with deaths occurring on or after January 1, 2011.
The interplay between the gift tax and the estate tax. Your estate is the total value of all of your assets, less any debts, at the time you die. The new rules for 2016 will tax estates over $5.45 million at rates as high as 40%.
Eating the right foods not only makes it easier for your body to digest meals and absorb nutrients, but it can also help you achieve a healthy body weight, another essential for good digestive tract health.
Eat a healthy diet. Photo Credit Tay Jnr/Digital Vision/Getty Images. Eat a diet rich in nutrients necessary for a healthy respiratory system. According to the University of Maryland Medical Center, low levels of certain nutrients have been linked to lung diseases.
Share. Your digestive system is where it all begins. You won’t produce energy, have a balanced mood, or fight illness if you can’t digest, break down, and absorb nutrients. There are many simple things you can do to keep your digestive system healthy, many of which are completely free.
Start Slideshow. For some of us, digestive discomfort has become a fact of life, like never getting enough sleep or having too much to do. We complain about everyday ailments such as occasional gas, bloating and irregularity, assuming they are inevitable. But they don't have to be.
Practicing yoga is an excellent way to keep your reproductive system healthy. It will help to keep proper balance between your mind and body, thereby keeping your overall health and reproductive system working. There are yoga poses which will keep your reproductive system healthy.
Quit smoking. If you want to keep a good reproductive health, you should definitely quit smoking. Smoking will affect the reproductive system of both men and women. Smoking can clog arteries and it can cause vasospasm.
Reproductive health problems can even affect your life with the associated emotional stress and anxiety. Knowing what all things you have to do to keep your reproductive system healthy is important. At the same time, it is imperative to know the factors that may affect your reproductive functions. Knowing these will help you avoid those risks.
You can promote respiratory health in many ways beyond not smoking. Whether using these strategies preventatively or to reduce symptoms of a condition such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, you can make a positive difference in the health of your respiratory system.
5 Tips for Healthy Digestion. Digestion begins in the mouth when you begin to chew. In fact, just the act of chewing thoroughly can take a huge strain off your digestive system by prompting your body to provide enzymes to help digestion. Here are a few other things you can do to promote healthy digestion.
For better digestive tract health, make these changes to your diet: 1  Eat plenty of fiber; think fruit, vegetables, and whole grains. 2  Eat three to five servings of fish each week. 3  Choose lean cuts of meat and remove the skin from poultry. 4  Stay well hydrated — water is best. 5  Avoid high-fat, processed, and fried foods.

I'm sure everyone experiences things differently to an extent, but having dealt with a considerable amount of stress and depression in my time, it absolutely does (in my experience) feel like a physical sensation. Chest tightens up, slight nausea, difficulty breathing.
1. Weakness in Your Arms and Legs. If you get weak or numb in your arm, leg, or face, it can be a sign of a stroke, especially if it's on one side of your body. You could also be having a stroke if you can't keep your balance, feel dizzy, or have trouble walking. Get help quickly if you suddenly can't see well, get a bad headache, feel confused, or have problems speaking or understanding. Caught early, it is often reversible, says internist Jacob Teitelbaum, MD.
Few people are taught that chest pressure can be caused by anxiety, but in reality it's one of the main symptoms of anxiety attacks. Not everyone experiences pressure. Some people experience chest pains (both sharp and dull). Others experience this feeling as though their heart is being squeezed.
Long-term emotional stress (like with depression or extended grieving), on the other hand, does all sorts of bad things to you. Your body's reaction to stress is to shift resources away from non-essential functions like digestion, tissue repair, and immune response.
But chest pressure is very often caused by anxiety, and unfortunately the more you worry about your heart health, the more likely you experience chest pressure that causes you to worry more.
This causes pain, nausea and muscle tightness in the chest -- hence the feeling that your heart is heavy, or those sharp pains when you see your crush with someone else. So essentially, your brain sends a message to a nerve. The nerve responds by making your muscles tighten in your chest. It feels like your heart is heavier, or that you're in pain, or both. When you stop being sad, your brain stops sending the message.
It may also mean that you have a blood clot moving into your lung, Teitelbaum says. If your chest feels tight or heavy, and it lasts more than a few minutes or goes away and comes back again, get help. Don't try to tough it out.
When the chest pressure is caused by bloating due to hyperventilation, burping can often relieve some of the discomfort. You can try shifting positions to see if that makes it easier for you to belch, or open your throat a little and try your best to push one out.
But once heart problems have been ruled out, you need to make sure that you understand that anxiety genuinely does cause chest pressure and even chest pain. Take my anxiety symptoms test to learn more about your anxiety.
Chest Pain. When it comes to chest pain, it's better to be safe than sorry. Any chest pain, especially accompanied by sweating, pressure, shortness of breath, or nausea, should be evaluated by a medical professional right away, says Shilpi Agarwal, MD, with One Medical Group in Washington, DC.
Running Doc: To avoid blisters get the proper shoes...socks...insoles...ointment...orthotics. The Running Doc’s advice on how to avoid blisters includes selecting the proper running shoe. Make sure it fits! Every time I run long distances, I get blisters all over my feet and in between my toes. I have tried socks with different thicknesses and Vaseline, and just about everything. Doc, I need your help to stop these blisters! I am running the ING NYC Marathon and don't want to be a mess after the race!
If there is an infection present, you may see that your blister has filled with pus and is yellowish or greenish in color. Medical conditions such as dyshidrosis (a form of eczema), herpes, and chickenpox can also cause blisters on one’s feet. Blisters are very common among athletes.
Blisters are often annoying, painful, or uncomfortable. In most cases, they are not a symptom of anything serious and will heal without any medical intervention. Some infections can cause skin blistering that requires treatment. And in rare cases a skin condition may produce blisters.
In my experience, the most common type are blisters on feet. These painful fluid-filled sacs are the result of increased temperatures that make your feet sweat and swell. This causes rubbing against your shoes, even the comfortable ones.
Generally blisters may be caused by: 1  Friction - the most common cause in the feet. 2  Direct damage to the skin by corrosive substances or heat. 3  Some infectious diseases (for example, chickenpox). 4  Some inherited diseases (for example, pompholyx).
Blisters are most common on the feet and ankles, as these are the areas most subject to heat and pressure in most people. Generally blisters may be caused by: Friction - the most common cause in the feet. Direct damage to the skin by corrosive substances or heat. Some infectious diseases (for example, chickenpox).
In addition to medication for the infection, your doctor may be able to give you something to treat the symptoms. If there is a known cause for the blisters, such as contact with a certain chemical or use of a drug, use of that product should be discontinued.
Friction occurs when something rubs against your skin for a prolonged period of time. This happens most commonly on hands and feet. Contact dermatitis can also cause blisters. This is a skin reaction to allergens, like poison ivy, latex, adhesives, or irritants like chemicals or pesticides.
The fluid inside a blister is called serum or plasma. This fluid is usually clear, but it can also be red if the blister is filled with blood, or yellowish green if it is filled with pus, indicating an infection. Blisters may appear on one foot or both feet, and they do not discriminate based on gender, age, or race. Blisters on feet can be caused by numerous things, including: Forceful rubbing or friction on the foot. Bone spurs or exostoses.
Narrow shoes can cause blisters on the big toe and little toe. A shallow toe box can lead to blisters on the tops of the toes, while loose shoes can create blisters on the tips of the toes. * When trying on shoes, be sure to wear the same socks, insoles, or orthotics that you wear when training or racing.
In doing so, the belief that a physical, Newtonian material universe that was at the very heart of scientific knowing was dropped, and the realization that matter is nothing but an illusion replaced it. Scientists began to recognize that everything in the Universe is made out of energy.
Ryan Biddulph Says: The most freeing aspect of being human is the fact we have a god-like part of us which molds our reality. The most confining aspect of being human is the fact we have a god-like part of us which molds our reality 😉. It really is that simple, difficult.
Conversely, it would be wrong to relegate our experience to the world of illusion. It is very real, the only reality we know. If I kick a boulder my foot hurts. The solidness of the stone is real in my experience; so is the pain. The illusion comes when we confuse the image in our mind with the thing-in-itself.
One great example that illustrates the role of consciousness within the physical material world (which we know not to be so physical) is the double slit experiment. This experiment has been used multiple times to explore the role of consciousness in shaping the nature of physical reality.
Once we realize we are creating our own reality, we begin to see how we are truly manifesting our lives. Each day we will observe more and as Oprah says, she believes everything follows Newton’s 3rd Law Of Motion: “For Every Action, There Is An Equal And Opposite Reaction“.
Reality is the state of things as they actually exist, rather than as they may appear or might be imagined. Reality includes everything that is and has been, whether or not it is observable or comprehensible. A still broader definition includes that which has existed, exists, or will exist.
What does it mean that our physical material reality isn’t really physical at all? It could mean a number of things, and concepts such as this cannot be explored if scientists remain within the boundaries of the only perceived world existing, the world we see.
The dictionary says that an illusion is a misleading image. So an illusion is something that has a particular reality to it, it’s just that this reality is a deceptive reality. Yet it seems to me that many people mistakenly think of an illusion as something that does not exist at all. You hear this kind of thing all the time.
By contrast existence is often restricted solely to that which has physical existence or has a direct basis in it in the way that thoughts do in the brain. Reality is often contrasted with what is imaginary, illusory, delusional, (only) in the mind, dreams, what is false, what is fictional, or what is abstract.
In Indian philosophy these two realities are sometimes referred to as the Absolute and the Relative. The Absolute is the underlying reality. It does not change according to who is experiencing it. It is, as it is, an independent reality. The Relative is the reality we observe, the reality generated in our minds.

Most of that is infrared, which has less energy than visible light but more than a microwave. It doesn't get to the center of the food as quickly as a microwave oven, because the longer wavelength penetrates more deeply, but it concentrates a lot more energy on the outside.
For instance, the electrons may come from radio waves, which contain much less energy than do microwaves, infrared rays, or visible light, or from a source that contains a much greater amount of energy, such as ultraviolet light or X-rays.
Electromagnetic radiation with a wavelength between 380 nm and 760 nm (400–790 terahertz) is detected by the human eye and perceived as visible light. Other wavelengths, especially near infrared (longer than 760 nm) and ultraviolet (shorter than 380 nm) are also sometimes referred to as light, especially when the visibility to humans is not relevant.
The difference between a long and short wavelength is the distance between two identical points on successive waves. Wavelength is also characteristic of the energy level of a particular wave, with...
Radio waves, gamma-rays, visible light, and all the other parts of the electromagnetic spectrum are electromagnetic radiation. Electromagnetic radiation can be described in terms of a stream of mass-less particles, called photons, each traveling in a wave-like pattern at the speed of light.
Wavelength of Indigo Light : The indigo lies between the blue color and the violet color and hence the wavelength of indigo lies between 420 nm to 450 nm. Wavelength of Infrared Light : Infrared (IR) radiation belongs to electromagnetic radiation spectrum. Infrared has a longer wavelength than visible light. Infrared is close to red colour in visible spectrum and hence it is sort of redder-than-red light or beyond red light, that is why the name infrared.

A recession begins just after the economy reaches a peak of activity and ends as the economy reaches its trough. Between trough and peak, the economy is in an expansion. Expansion is the normal state of the economy; most recessions are brief and they have been rare in recent decades.

The term refers to the general aspects of biological form and arrangement of the parts of a plant or an animal. The term anatomy also refers to the study of biological structure but usually suggests study of the details of either gross or microscopic structure.
SCI 220A: Microbiology. Colony Morphology: Describing Bacterial Colonies. Frequently during the semester you will need to describe bacterial (or fungal) growth observed on slants or Petri plates. It will be useful to learn the terminology used for describing common colony types. The following outline will be helpful for verbally communicating the appearance of observed colonial growth. 1. Form – The form refers to the shape of the colony.
The best known aspect of morphology, usually called anatomy, is the study of gross structure, or form, of organs and organisms. It should not be inferred however, that even the human body, which has been extensively studied, has been so completely explored that nothing remains to be discovered.
Morphology, leaf: common leaf morphologiesEncyclopædia Britannica, Inc.in biology, the study of the size, shape, and structure of animals, plants, and microorganisms and of the relationships of the parts comprising them.
A root is like a stem in constituting the core of the word to which. other pieces attach, but the term refers only to morphologically simple. units. For example, disagree is the stem of disagreement, because it is the base. to which -ment attaches, but agree is the root.
These are everyday morphological facts, the kind you run across every. day as a literate speaker of English. What these words – rebop, unbreak, uncry, hobbit, quirkologist, smorgsaphobia, and deinstitutionalization – have. in common is their newness.
Bacterial colonies are frequently shiny and smooth in appearance. Other surface descriptions might be: veined, rough, dull, wrinkled (or shriveled), glistening. 1c. Color – It is important to describe the color or pigment of the colony. Also include descriptive terms for any other relevant optical characteristics such as: opaque, cloudy, translucent, iridescent. 2. Elevation – This describes the “side view” of a colony. These are the most common.
The term morphology is generally attributed to the German poet, novelist, playwright, and philosopher Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1749–1832), who coined it early in the nineteenth century in a biological context. Its. etymology is Greek: morph- means ‘shape, form’, and morphology is the. study of form or forms. In biology morphology refers to the study of the. form and structure of organisms, and in geology it refers to the study of. the conﬁguration and evolution of land forms. In linguistics morphology. refers to the mental system involved in word formation or to the branch.
A thorough knowledge of structure (morphology) is of fundamental importance to the physician, to the veterinarian, and to the plant pathologist, all of whom are concerned with the kinds and causes of the structural changes that result from specific diseases.
In practice, however, the two terms are used almost synonymously. Typically, morphology is contrasted with physiology, which deals with studies of the functions of organisms and their parts; function and structure are so closely interrelated, however, that their separation is somewhat artificial.

(1) Egoistic suicide: According to Durkheim, when a man becomes socially isolated or feels that he has no place in the society he destroys himself.urkheim has established the view that there are no societies in which suicide does not occur. Rejecting most of the accepted theories of suicide, Durkheim on the basis of his monographic studies claims suicide as primarily a social phenomena in terms of the breakdown of the vital bond of life.
Durkheim explores the differing suicide rates among Protestants and Catholics, arguing that stronger social control among Catholics results in lower suicide rates. According to Durkheim, Catholic society has normal levels of integration while Protestant society has low levels.uicide (French: Le Suicide) is an 1897 book written by French sociologist Émile émile. durkheim

(Anomie was a concept Durkheim developed to describe a state where social and/or moral norms were confused, unclear, or simply not present.onetheless, critics have elucidated two limitations to Durkheim’s system for classifying types of suicide: (1). Whereas all in a group are subject to the same social structures, Durkheim’s classification system does not clarify as to why one individual commits suicide while other members of the same group do not.
(2). Altruistic; With altruistic suicide, Durkheim argued that certain types of suicide occurred among tightly knit groups when they came under severe threat; in such situations, members were prepared to die in the group’s defense.onetheless, critics have elucidated two limitations to Durkheim’s system for classifying types of suicide: (1).

The vowels are A, E, I, O, and U. Numerology considers all other letters to be consonants, except the letter Y. When determining if the Y is a vowel or a consonant in a numerology chart, the basic rule is this: When the letter serves as a vowel, and in fact sounds like one, it is a vowel. The same is true when the Y serves as the only vowel in the syllable.
Definition of consonant for Students. 1  1 : a letter in the English alphabet other than a, e, i, o, or u. 2  2 : a speech sound (as \p\, \n\, or \s\) produced by partly or completely stopping the flow of air breathed out of the mouth.
All you do is add the ending to whatever word you want. The only exceptions are words that end in y preceded by a consonant. For such words, first change the y to i and then add the suffix. When a word ends in a vowel and a y, just add the suffix.
Y as a Vowel. 1 comment. It is more common to find the letter “y” as a vowel than as a consonant. Typically, the letter “y” is a consonant when it is at the beginning of a word, e.g., yes, you, yard and young. If the letter “y” is located in the middle or end of the word, it is often treated as a vowel. As always, there are exceptions, e.g., lawyer, canyon & beyond. Y as a Vowel – Long E. When the letter y is found at the end of a word, it sometimes makes the long e sound as noted in the table below.
While consonance and dissonance exist only between sounds and therefore necessarily describe intervals (or chords), such as the perfect intervals, which are often viewed as consonant (e.g., the unison and octave), Occidental music theory often considers that, in a dissonant chord, one of the tones alone is in itself deemed to be the dissonance: it is this tone in particular that needs resolution through a specific voice leading procedure.
This file includes worksheets to practice writing plural nouns for words that end with y. The number of words to sort is different on each, but the task is the same. Rules: consonant + y = drop the y add -ies vowel + y= just add -s I asked my students look at the first word, boy, and determine wh
A, E, I, O, U, and sometimes Y. I don’t know. Maybe this isn’t taught to children any more! “Y” is a vowel in words like “any, many, story, day.” “Y” is considered a consonant in words like “yes, yesterday, young.” Technically, it is a semivowel. (A semivowel is a vowel-like sound which functions as a consonant.
Each spoken consonant can be distinguished by several phonetic features: 1  The manner of articulation is how air escapes from the vocal tract when the consonant or approximant (vowel-like) sound is made. Manners include stops, fricatives, and nasals.
Building words 4 - suffixes and spelling rules. Remember suffixes are small words that we add to the end of words to make new words or change the grammar. Sometimes we have to change the root word and sometimes double up letters so let's have a look at some rules around adding suffixes.
nice - nicely, quiet - quietly, quick - quickly, beautiful - beautifully. 1  If the adjective ends in consonant +y, change the y to i before adding –ly. easy - easily. 2  If the adjective ends in –le, drop the -e and add –y. possible - possibly.
Adjustment, in psychology, the behavioral process by which humans and other animals maintain an equilibrium among their various needs or between their needs and the obstacles of their environments. A sequence of adjustment begins when a need is felt and ends when it is satisfied. Hungry people, for example, are stimulated by their physiological state to seek food. When they eat, they reduce the stimulating condition that impelled them to activity, and they are thereby adjusted to this particular need.
A chiropractor performs an adjustment on a patient. Spinal adjustment and chiropractic adjustment are terms used by chiropractors to describe their approaches to spinal manipulation, as well as some osteopaths, who use the term adjustment. Spinal adjustments were among many chiropractic techniques invented in the 19th century by Daniel David Palmer, a magnetic healer.

In this proposed model, any of the items listed above that are left out of the company's post-closing adjustment process generally will result in a control deficiency, since they must be identified and included in the normal post-closing adjustment process.
Chiropractic is a specialized field in the healing arts, and by prior rights, the spinal adjustment is distinct and singular to the chiropractic profession.. One author claims that this concept is now repudiated by mainstream chiropractic.
In this way, people increase their familiarity and comfort with their environments, and they come to expect that their needs will be met in the future through their social networks. Ongoing difficulties in social and cultural adjustment may be accompanied by anxiety or depression.
adjustment disorder a mental disorder characterized by a maladaptive reaction to identifiable stressful life events, such as divorce, loss of job, physical illness, or natural disaster; this diagnosis assumes that the condition will remit when the stress ceases or when the patient adapts to the situation.
Claims made for the benefits of spinal adjustments range from temporary, palliative (pain relieving) effects to long term wellness and preventive care. There is no good scientific evidence that spinal adjustment is effective against disease.
Social and cultural adjustments are similar to physiological adjustments. People strive to be comfortable in their surroundings and to have their psychological needs (such as love or affirmation) met through the social networks they inhabit.

The sedimentation rate (sed rate) blood test measures how quickly red blood cells (erythrocytes) settle in a test tube in one hour. The more red cells that fall to the bottom of the test tube in one hour, the higher the sed rate.
Guide. The sedimentation rate (sed rate) blood test measures how quickly red blood cells (erythrocytes) settle in a test tube in one hour. The more red cells that fall to the bottom of the test tube in one hour, the higher the sed rate.
A sedimentation rate is common blood test that is used to detect and monitor inflammation in the body. The sedimentation rate is also called the erythrocyte sedimentation rate because it is a measure of the speed that the red blood cells (erythrocytes) in a tube of blood fall to the bottom of the tube, or sediment.
Sedimentation Rate (Sed Rate). Guide. The sedimentation rate (sed rate) blood test measures how quickly red blood cells (erythrocytes) settle in a test tube in one hour. The more red cells that fall to the bottom of the test tube in one hour, the higher the sed rate.
A sedimentation rate is common blood test that is used to detect and monitor inflammation in the body. The sedimentation rate is also called the erythrocyte sedimentation rate because it is a measure of the red blood cells (erythrocytes) sedimenting in a tube over a given period of time.
The sedimentation rate (sed rate) blood test measures how quickly red blood cells (erythrocytes) settle in a test tube in one hour.
The sedimentation rate test measures inflammation in the body. It is also called the sed rate or the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) test. It is a blood test. It determines how quickly red blood cells sink in a tube of blood.
A high sed rate blood test indicates inflammation in the body. This is because during inflammation, some specific proteins make the red blood cells stick to each other and become heavier. This causes them to fall to the bottom of the tube, more quickly than is otherwise normal.
Sedimentation Rate (Sed Rate). Guide. The sedimentation rate (sed rate) blood test measures how quickly red blood cells (erythrocytes) settle in a test tube in one hour.
The sed rate blood test is quite common and is used for detecting and monitoring inflammation inside the body. It collects red blood cells (erythrocytes) in a test tube, and then measures the sedimentation rate (sed rate) of this blood over a specific period of time.
Osteon: tube shaped structure in bones with an open space for blood vessels, veins, and nerves in the center. Platelet: a small cell fragment without a nucleus that helps stop blood the flow of blood when the body is injured.
If you looked at it through a microscope, however, you would see that it's actually filled with many very tiny passages, or canals, for nerves and blood vessels. Compact bone is made of special cells called osteocytes. These cells are lined up in rings around the canals. Together, a canal and the osteocytes that surround it are called osteons.
Definition of Osteocyte. An osteocyte is a bone-forming cell that has become entrapped within the bone matrix (the hard part of the bone). It lies within a lacuna, a small pit, and communicates with its surroundings through tiny channels called canaliculi.
The inside story. Bones are made of four main kinds of cells: osteoclasts, osteoblasts, osteocytes, and lining cells. Notice that three of these cell type names start with 'osteo.' This is the Greek word for bone. When you see 'osteo' as part of a word, it lets you know that the word has something to do with bones.
This might happen for a number of reasons: 1  When a bone breaks, a thick lump of bone called a hard callus forms around the break in the process of healing. 2  When new blood vessels, nerves, and veins are needed in an area, osteoclasts break down bone material to make new passages.
Osteocytes have long, branching arms that connect them to neighboring osteocytes. This lets them exchange minerals and communicate with other cells in the area. Lining cells are very flat bone cells.
Looking at the osteons in bone (A) under a microscope reveals tube-like osteons (B) made up of osteocytes (C). These bone cells have long branching arms (D) which lets them communicate with other cells. Spongy bone. Spongy bone is found mostly at the ends of bones and joints. About 20% of the bone in your body is spongy.
Osteocytes are mature osteoblasts that have become trapped within the very bone matrix they produced. Osteocytes continue to form bone to some degree, which is important for maintaining the strength and health of the bone matrix. However, osteocytes perform functions that extend far beyond simple maintenance.
Bone Anatomy. show/hide words to know. Bone marrow: the tissue in the middle of bones that creates red and white blood cells... Compact bone: the heaviest, hardest type of bone in the body. Lining cell: flat cells that make up and cover the outer layer of bone. Marrow: a soft tissue found inside bones.
Osteoclasts break down and reabsorb existing bone. 1  The second part of the word, 'clast,' comes from the Greek word for 'break,' meaning these cells break down bone material. Osteoclasts are very big and often contain more than one nucleus, which happens when two or more cells get fused together.

Most roofing is 4 bundles per 100 sf for dimensionals plus waste of about 20 to 30 per cent or 3 per square for regular shingles. Here is a link to a prior question on this subject - good info on things to remember, why you need extra shingles, etc.
Composition(asphault) shingles are 3 bundles to a square..however, cedar shakes(shingles) are slightly differnet about 4 bundles to the square..here is the formula... It takes 4 bundles to cover 100 sq ft using 18 perfections @ 5-1/2 exposure. Perfections are a 18/18 pack - so lets prove it out..
Best Answer: 1 bundle of shingles covers 33 1/3 square feet. There are three bundles in a square and 1 square equals 100 sqare feet. This will depend upon what you are calling a bundle of standard CEDAR shingles. I don't think anyone has picked up on the cedar part.
Walls 2: 12’ x 12’ = 144 square feet x 2 = 288 square feet. Gable Ends: 12’ x 4’ divided by 2 = 24 square feet x 2 = 48 square feet. *Formula for calculating triangles: ½ base x height thus, one would purchase 8-1/2 square (34 bundles) of cedar shingles to cover this building. Totaling the number of square feet, we have 816 square feet to be covered. You would purchase 8-81/2 square (34 bundles) of cedar shingles to cover this building. Click here for a printable form to guide you in estimating the amount of shingles you are going to need.
It is the size of the roof! You need to measure the slope of each side of the roof by the length to come up with the sf of the roof. Most roofing is 4 bundles per 100 sf for dimensionals plus waste of about 20 to 30 per cent or 3 per square for regular shingles. Don.
VIDEO – Time and Materials Study. The labor (time) savings is complemented by the material savings resulting from IKO’s three bundles per full square coverage advantage. Many roofing professionals are surprised to learn that three bundles of the competitors’ shingles only provide 98.44 or 96.88 square feet of coverage. When you consider a 23 square roof for example, IKO’s three bundles per full square would require 69 bundles. The competitors’ product would require 71 to 72 bundles, respectively. That translates to an increase in the contractors’ direct job costs by as much as 2-3 bundles on a 23 square project.
1 how many bundles of shingles to repair a 665 square foot carport with 3 tab shingles. 2  approximate cost of hvac duct for 1200 square foot home.  How many bundles of asphalt roofing to repair 1312 sq. roof on my home.
To do this, the contractor would need to account for the fact that IKO’s Cambridge shingles feature a larger-than-metric, 60 shingles per square. This represents an average of four-to-six less shingles per square than many of the comparable competitive brands.
standard asphalt roofing shingles which are either 3 or 4 bundles to a square and a square is equal to 100 square feet , or 10'x10' so 1 bundle of 3 bundles per square shingles would just cover 1 standard (US) 4x8 sheet of plywood (32. square feet).
He was the third of four children of Joseph Ruggles Wilson (1822–1903) and Jessie Janet Woodrow (1826–1888). Wilson's paternal grandparents immigrated to the United States from Strabane, County Tyrone, Ireland (now Northern Ireland), in 1807.
Woodrow Wilson’s second term in office was dominated by World War I. Although the president had advocated for peace during the initial years of the war, in early 1917 German submarines launched unrestricted submarine attacks against U.S. merchant ships.
The treaty was met with serious concern by Senate Republicans, and Wilson rejected a compromise effort led by Henry Cabot Lodge, leading to the Senate's rejection of the treaty. Due to his stroke, Wilson secluded himself in the White House, disability having diminished his power and influence.
A+E Networks. Woodrow Wilson (1856-1924), the 28th U.S. president, served in office from 1913 to 1921 and led America through World War I (1914-1918). An advocate for democracy and world peace, Wilson is often ranked by historians as one of the nation’s greatest presidents.
Woodrow Wilson was the president who led the United States through World War I. He was also very educated: he was the first U.S. president to have a PhD. 2 people found this useful. Edit. Share to: 1  The Family Tree of Woodrow Wilson Thomas Woodrow Wilson was the 28th President of the United States and was generally addressed by his middle name instead of Thomas.
Thomas Woodrow Wilson (December 28, 1856 – February 3, 1924) was an American politician and academic who served as the 28th President of the United States from 1913 to 1921.
In his 1915 State of the Union, Wilson asked Congress for what became the Espionage Act of 1917 and the Sedition Act of 1918, suppressing anti-war movements. His crackdown was intensified by his Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer to include non-citizen antiwar activists during the First Red Scare of 1919–1920.

Creating a contra account for payables and receivables in a bartering situation is advantageous to both parties who have something to offer, but no real cash. These transactions, however, must appear on the books because I now own a piece of equipment that is an asset and will depreciate.
What Is a Contra Account? Basically, contra accounts in financial accounting can be any two accounts that offset one another. While these accounts work against one another, and often show up in balance sheet accounts, they don’t follow the same rules as double entry bookkeeping entries, and in effect, are utilized to balance books.
For example, an asset may also be a liability, especially if the business owner and customer are one and the same. Contra Accounts for A/R and A/P As I mentioned previously, because I am the owner of more than one business, I often utilize the services of one business that should be paid by the other business.
In some situations, business owners can find they will benefit from creating a contra account between payables and receivables. Examples of using a contra account can include if a business owner has two companies that utilize one another's services or in a bartering situation.
What's the difference between Accounts Payable and Accounts Receivable? How a transaction is recorded in the General Ledger (GL) depends upon the nature of the transaction. Accounts Payable (AP) is recorded in the AP sub-ledger when an invoice is approved for transactions where the company must pay money to vendors for the pur...
Accounts payable is recorded when an invoice is approved for payment. Many companies use “segregation of duties,” i.e. making sure no single employee can approve a payment alone, to prevent embezzlement. For most businesses, accounts receivable involves the generation of an invoice, which is delivered to the customer.
Pros and Cons of A/R & A/P Contra Accounts. In the accounting scenarios above, by creating a contra account between payables and receivables, both of my businesses show an existing asset and a liability. While my bookkeepers at both businesses may send out Accounts Payable statements each month to one another, it’s really up to me whether I want to actually exchange cash or allow the debits and credits to offset themselves.
Accounts Payable (AP) is recorded in the AP sub-ledger when an invoice is approved for transactions where the company must pay money to vendors for the purchase services or goods. On the other hand, Accounts Receivable (AR) records any money that a company is owed because of the sale of their goods or services. On the company's balance sheet, accounts payables are recorded as liabilities while receivables are recorded as assets.
Accounts receivables are analyzed by the average number of days to collect payment (called Days Sales Outstanding or DSO), and accounts payable are analyzed by the average number of days it takes to pay an invoice (Days Payable Outstanding or DPO).
A contra account is an account with a balance opposite the normal accounts in its category.

Mermaid’s Purse. These hard dried out egg cases can often be found washed up on the beach. They have the magical name of ‘mermaid’s purse’. In reality, they are the empty egg cases of a dogfish, skate or ray, each species looking slightly different. In these fish, the egg is fertilised by the male inside the female’s body and she then lays them in pairs in these egg cases.
It is a lovely idea that the mermaid has a purse and has lost it. It features in a number of mermaid stories and is the subject of a poem by Ted Hughes, in his collection of the same name. Mermaids, creatures that are half woman half fish, occur in mythological stories around the world.
Here is a mermaid's purse, or skate egg case. Sometimes if you hold it up to the sun, you can see the baby skate wiggling around inside. If the skate has already hatched, then you will see an opening at one end between the two horns.
with additions by Andy Horton. Regular rockpoolers are likely to have come across 'Mermaid's Purses', containing the eggs or young of the Lesser-spotted Dogfish, Scyliorhinus canicula, lying amongst the debris on the tideline. These egg capsules that have been dislodged after being laid by the adult female dogfish are doomed to perish.
Because the sac had not been punctured, Dr Tsigris said the baby did not even realise it had been born and behaved as if it was still inside the mother's womb. 1  A glimpse into the womb: This astonishing photograph, taken by obstetrician Dr Aris Tsigris, shows the baby who was delivered inside an intact amniotic sac.
Mermaid’s Purses. Mermaid’s purses are the egg cases of dogfish and skates. The parent fish attaches these egg cases to objects such as seaweeds growing on the sea bed. Empty egg cases from which the baby fish have hatched out, are often found washed up along the strand line of sandy beaches.
Occasionally a storm may rip the seaweed and egg cases from the sea bed and throw them up with the eggs or a baby fish still inside. Mermaid’s purses are made of collagen which is a common protein found in vertebrate animal tissues that is slow to break down and so may persist in the sea for months or years.
Until the sac is punctured the baby will behave as if it is still inside its mother. The amniotic sac is a bag of fluid inside the womb where the unborn baby develops and grows. It is also referred to as the ‘membranes’, because the sac is made of two membranes called the amnion and the chorion. The sac is filled with clear, pale fluid, in which the unborn baby floats and moves.
What comes out of those mermaid’s purses? About a month ago, one of our students found a mermaid’s purse in the Captiva seagrass beds. We often find these egg cases washed up in the wrack line and are sometimes lucky enough to see a tiny creature wiggling around inside.
Egg case (Chondrichthyes) Baby active inside egg case. An egg case or egg capsule, colloquially known as a mermaid's purse or devil's purse, is a casing that surrounds the fertilized eggs of some sharks, skates, and chimaeras. They are made of collagen protein strands.

What are keloid scars? Keloid scars are firm, smooth, hard growths due to spontaneous scar formation. They can arise soon after an injury, or develop months later. Keloids may be uncomfortable or itchy, and may be much larger than the original wound.
What are hypertrophic scars? As wounds heal, scar tissue forms, which at first is often red and somewhat prominent. Over several months, a scar usually becomes flat and pale. If there is a lot of tension on a healing wound, the healing area is rather thicker than usual. This is known as a hypertrophic scar.
Scars are areas of fibrous tissue (fibrosis) that replace normal skin after injury. A scar results from the biological process of wound repair in the skin and other tissues of the body. Thus, scarring is a natural part of the healing process. With the exception of very minor lesions, every wound (e.g., after accident, disease, or surgery) results in some degree of scarring. An exception to this are animals with complete regeneration, which regrow tissue without scar formation.
Epidermal hyperplasia overlying a melanocytic nevus is a phenomenon reported in up to one third of all melanocytic nevi (see the image below).This finding can be seen in junctional, compound, or intradermal melanocytic nevi.

Fujita scale. The Fujita scale (F-Scale), or Fujita–Pearson scale (FPP scale), is a scale for rating tornado intensity, based primarily on the damage tornadoes inflict on human-built structures and vegetation.
Fujita knew that there were other empirical measurements that could be made between seventy-four miles per hour and the speed of sound (Mach 1, or approximately seven hundred and sixty miles per hour), and that these would be important in measuring the destructiveness of tornadoes.
A key point to remember is this: the size of a tornado is not necessarily an indication of its intensity. Large tornadoes can be weak, and small tornadoes can be violent. A good example of a relatively small tornado would be the Pampa, Texas tornado of 1995, which can be seen in Tornado Video Classics III.
Kocin and Uccellini’s rating system comes two years after another 1-to-5 winter storm ranking was proposed by Gregory Zielinski of the University of Maine. Zielinski’s system focuses on the intensity of the storm and its speed of movement as a way to assist forecasters in warning the public. It does not, however, include a measure of the population likely to be affected by the storm.
Map of the full path of the Joplin tornado on May 22, 2011. Darker colors indicate more severe damage. The numbered points give the recorded intensity of the tornado on the Enhanced Fujita Scale at that location. (Photo: NOAA/NWS) Tornado wind speeds typically can't be directly measured by traditional equipment, as nothing can withstand their savage winds. Thus, authorities rely on damage reports after a tornado hits to judge its intensity via what's known as the Enhanced Fujita Scale of Tornado Intensity.

Their new Northeast Snowfall Impact Scale, or NESIS, is being published this week in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society. Only post-blizzard for now The ratings are designed to assess the impact of a storm after it is over, the way the Fujita scale is used to rate tornadoes. Kocin said he can foresee a day when it might be possible to develop the blizzard scale for use in warning of coming events the way the Saffir-Simpson scale is used with hurricanes.
exists and is an alternate of . There are three scales used to assess tornado intensity. The oldest and most well-known is the Fujita scale or F scale. This scale uses the severity of damage cause by a tornado to estimate wind speed and sort it into one of six categories ranging from F0 tor the weakest tornadoes to F5 for the strongest.
Tornado intensity. Tornado intensity can be measured by in situ or remote sensing measurements, but since these are impractical for wide scale use, intensity is usually inferred via proxies, such as damage. The Fujita scale and the Enhanced Fujita scale rate tornadoes by the damage caused. The Enhanced Fujita Scale was an upgrade to the older Fujita scale, with engineered wind estimates and better damage descriptions, but was designed so that a tornado rated on the Fujita scale would receive the same numerical rat
What are the names of the scales used to measure the intensity of a tornado? The intensity of tornadoes is measured on the Fujita-Pearson Tornado Intensity Scale, or F-Scale. This scale was named after the men who developed it, Dr. Theodore Fujit … a, and Allan Pearson, head of the Forecast Center in Kansas City.
Unlike many other ethnic groups in the United States, Creoles did not migrate from a native country. The term Creole was first used in the sixteenth century to identify descendants of French, Spanish, or Portuguese settlers living in the West Indies and Latin America.
Overview. Unlike many other ethnic groups in the United States, Creoles did not migrate from a native country. The term Creole was first used in the sixteenth century to identify descendants of French, Spanish, or Portuguese settlers living in the West Indies and Latin America.
The term Creole was first used in the sixteenth century to identify descendants of French, Spanish, or Portuguese settlers living in the West Indies and Latin America. There is general agreement that the term Creole derives from the Portuguese word crioulo, which means a slave born in the master's household.
Creole History A definition of Creole from the earliest history in New Orleans (circa 1718) is a child born in the colony as opposed to France or Spain. (see Criollo). The definition became more codified after the United States took control of the city and Louisiana in 1803.

French was the language of white Creoles; it should not be confused with Louisiana Creole (LC). Morphologically and lexically Louisiana Creole resembles Saint-Domingue Creole, although there is evidence that Louisiana Creole was well established by the time Saint-Domingue refugees arrived in Louisiana.
History of the Term “Creole”. The term “Creole” was coined in the 16th century by Spanish and Portuguese colonials and originally used to refer to individuals born in colonies who were of Portuguese, Spanish or African descent.
Just look up Creole in a dictionary and youll get several very distinct definitions. Our uses: Creole-people of color with light skin, often of African and French descent. French Creole-Caucasian people descended from some of the first Europeans to arrive in New Orleans.
Older Creoles complain that many young Creoles today do not adhere to the basic rules of language propriety in speaking to others, especially to older adults. They claim that children walk past homes of people they know without greeting an acquaintance sitting on the porch or working on the lawn.
Vitamin B-12 and other B vitamins play a role in producing brain chemicals that affect mood and other brain functions. Low levels of B-12 and other B vitamins such as vitamin B-6 and folate may be linked to depression. Low levels of a vitamin can result from eating a poor diet or not being able to absorb the vitamins you consume. Older adults, vegetarians and people with digestive disorders such as celiac disease or Crohn's disease may have trouble getting enough B-12.
The best way to make sure you're getting enough B-12 and other vitamins is to eat a healthy diet that includes sources of essential nutrients. Vitamin B-12 is plentiful in animal products such as fish, lean meat, poultry, eggs, and low-fat and fat-free milk.
However, B-12 and other vitamin supplements can interact with some medications, especially in high doses. Talk to your doctor before you take a vitamin supplement. Keep in mind, the role of B vitamins in depression isn't clear.
B-Complex. At Nature Made, we’ve created several B-complex offerings because we’re committed to helping you manage your unique health needs with high quality nutrients.
Like mentioned earlier, the probable cause of low vitamin B12 is the inability to successfully absorb the B12 vitamin into the body from the intestinal tract. This is caused by a certain disease known pernicious anemia.
CoQ10 Plus B Vitamins for Energy Learn why it may be important to supplement your diet with CoQ10 and B vitamins: key nutrients that help your body maintain a healthy supply of energy.
Vitamin B12 is recurrently combined and used with the other B Vitamins in the complex formulation of vitamin B. This helps in the maintenance of healthy red blood cells and nerve cells and is needed too in making DNA which is the genetic component of all the cells. Vitamin b12 is conjoined to protein found in the food.
Low Vitamin B12 can cause a lot of weakness in the body and make you prone to various types of illnesses. Vitamin B12 is a vital water-soluble vitamin which is commonly found in various foods such as dairy products, meat, shellfish, eggs and fish.
Vitamin B12 deficiency symptoms. Low vitamin B12 symptoms can be in the form of muscle weakness, skin tingling, numbness, sleeping problems (inability to sleep) anxiety, poor balance, tiredness and more colds in a year.

Spider plants, also commonly known as ribbon plants, spider ivy, St. Bernard's lily or airplane plants, are perennial members of the lily family. Easy to grow as house plants, spider plants propagate themselves by shooting off baby plants, or plantlets, while the mother plant continues to grow in size.
Spider plants usually flower in the summer, and new offshoots (called babies or plantlets) grow out of those flowers. There are several ways to propagate spider plants. The most common is by rooting the babies and growing them as new plants.
Spider plants are very easy to propagate because, when they reach maturity, they put out runners with small plantlets called stolons. These stolons are easy to snip off the plant and grown into entirely new spider plants.

Spider plants are very easy to propagate. The ideal method is to allow the plantlet to root while it is still attached to the mother plant. Set a pot filled with sterile potting soil within reach of one of the plantlets and just place the offset onto the surface of the soil.
Now on to the propagation. Spider plants are very easy to propagate because, when they reach maturity, they put out runners with small plantlets called stolons. These stolons are easy to snip off the plant and grown into entirely new spider plants.
Easy to grow as house plants, spider plants propagate themselves by shooting off baby plants, or plantlets, while the mother plant continues to grow in size. When the mother plant gets so large that it is spilling from the pot, or becomes pot bound, it is time to divide and transplant it. Ad.
Planting spiderettes in potting soil is the easiest and quickest way to propagate spider plant babies. However, if you like, you can stick the spiderette in a glass of water for a week or two, then plant the rooted spiderette in a pot of soil.

IN SEARCH OF AN ANSWER. It may be difficult to find, but it's not impossible. And CD Projekt Red doesn't shy away from it, either. Last week, the developer announced two paid downloadable add-ons for The Witcher 3. To quantify their size, the developer said they amount to more than 30 hours of play time.
how long is this game if you do everything that includes x2. It's been a long time since I played 'em on PS2, but IIRC, it's something like: FFX: 40-50 hours to complete, ~75 hours to 100% (secret summons & sidequests). FFX-2: 20-25 hours to complete, ~35 hours to 100% (sidequests + dresspheres + true ending). ---. And you see where that can lead you, into what mistakes and absurdities, when you are dealing with a man like Arsene Lupin..
FFXIII also took about 100 hours to platinum. – Glen Wheeler Mar 26 '12 at 8:24. Remember kids, if a question provides an answer with a link that could answer your question, it's a duplicate! – Studoku Apr 17 '14 at 17:49. @Studoku No, we dupe ALL game completion to this one. It's our one concession to these, due to their inherently subjective nature.
I did the Platinum in ~70 hours (I'm a PS3 user). On the TrophyHuntersCommunity (French website) trophy guide for FFXIII-2, it's says Temps necessaire nécessaire pour le: platine 65 heures which Means time necessary for The: platinum 65. hours
March 16th, 2015 by Sharjeel Hanif. After a nearly forty hour play through of Final Fantasy Type-0 HD, I find it telling that my first instinct is to jump right into new game plus.
He's seen players fly through in 40 minutes and watched others spend four or five hours. He knows someone who's played 200 hours of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt and still hasn't seen all the content. No matter how long it is, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt will arrive on May 19, 2015, for PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Windows PC. And CD Projekt Red will continue learning.
Excellent! was looking for the same kind of data! so at the highest the game can go for 58 whooping hours!!! – GamDroid Feb 21 '12 at 14:26. Yes, it seems to get 100% complete you will need around 60 hours. – acalypso Feb 21 '12 at 14:39.
Armed with insider knowledge that most players won't have, it still took The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt 's most experienced playtester 25 hours to complete developer CD Projekt Red's upcoming role-playing game — but that's not the whole story.
Disclaimer: A copy of the standard edition of Final Fantasy Type-0 HD was provided to Final Fantasy Network by Square Enix at no expense for reviewing purposes.

So by age 8, children should have all eight of their permanent incisors in place. After a two-year break (about age 10), the next four baby teeth to be lost are the lower canines and upper first molars. These are typically followed around age 11 by the lower first molars.
A child's baby teeth (primary teeth) begin to loosen and fall out to make room for permanent teeth at about age 6. The first baby teeth to fall out are typically the two bottom front teeth (lower central incisors) and the two top front teeth (upper central incisors), followed by the lateral incisors, molars and canines. Molars typically fall out between ages 9 and 12 and are replaced by permanent teeth by about age 13.
The first baby teeth (also known as primary teeth) to come in are usually the lower central incisors around the age of six months. The last baby teeth to show up are the upper second primary molars, and they appear between 30 and 36 months of age. There are normally 20 baby teeth by the time a child reaches age 3. These primary teeth then remain unchanged for about three years. Not much happens to the baby teeth between 3 and 6 years of age. Between 6 and 8 years however, there is a flurry of activity as kids normally lose eight primary teeth in rapid succession.
Most children lose their baby teeth in this order: Baby teeth ordinarily are shed first at about age 6 when the incisors, the middle teeth in front, become loose. Molars, in the back, are usually shed between ages 10 and 12, and are replaced with permanent teeth by about age 13. Children usually wiggle their teeth loose with their tongues or fingers, eager to hide them under their pillow for the tooth fairy..
Baby teeth usually stay in place until they are pushed out by permanent teeth. If a child loses a baby tooth early as a result of tooth decay or an accident, the teeth beside it might drift into the empty space.
Brushing and flossing. Your child may need some help brushing until he is between ages 7 and 10. Even if his intentions are good, he may not have the dexterity to clean his teeth well. Ideally, the teeth should be brushed within five minutes to 10 minutes after eating.
When your child starts to lose his or her baby teeth, reinforce the importance of proper dental care. For example: 1  Remind your child to brush his or her teeth at least twice a day. 2  Supervise and offer assistance as needed. 3  Help your child floss his or her teeth daily.
Adult teeth. By the age of 12 to 14, most children have lost all their baby teeth and have their adult teeth. There are 32 adult teeth in total, 12 more than in the baby set. The last four of these, called wisdom teeth, usually emerge later than the others, generally between the ages of 17 and 21.
Teeth vary in size, shape and their location in the jaws. These differences enable teeth to work together to help you chew, speak and smile. They also help give your face its shape and form. At birth people usually have 20 primary (baby) teeth, which often erupt about 6 months of age. They are then shed at various times throughout childhood. By age 21, all 32 of the permanent teeth have usually erupted.
Babies' teeth begin to develop before they are born, but in most cases don't come through until they're between 6 and 12 months old. Most children have a full set of 20 milk or baby teeth by the time they're three years old. When they reach five or six, these teeth will start to fall out, making way for adult teeth.
1 To find sin (x/2), we use the following half angle formula. 2  sin (x/2) = + or-SQRT [ (1 - cos x) / 2 3  ]. sin (x/2) = SQRT [ (1 - cos x) / 2 4  ]. Given that sin (x) = 1 / 4, we use the trigonometric identity sin x + cos x = 1 to find cos x, noting that x is in quadrant 2 and cos x is negative.uestions 2: x is in quadrant 3, approximate sin (2 x) if cos (x) = - 0.2.

The corresponding acute angle of 135° is 45°. In the second quadrant, the cosine is negative and the sine is positive. Therefore, x = r cos θ = 1 · cos 135° = −cos 45° = −½ .y = r sin θ = 1 · sin 135° = sin 45° = ½ . Problem 8. Radius AB of length 2 sweeps out an angle of −60°.he corresponding acute angle of 135° is 45°. In the second quadrant, the cosine is negative and the sine is positive. Therefore, x = r cos θ = 1 · cos 135° = −cos 45° = −½ .
10 r (x, y) θ O y x. Definition 2.1: Trigonometric Functions of a General Angle Let θ be an angle in standard position and suppose that (x, y) is any point other than (0, 0) on the terminal side of θ (Figure 2.3).s Figure 2b shows, an angle of ‐187° is a quadrant II angle. If the terminal side of an angle in standard position lies along either the x axis or the y axis, then the angle is called quadrantal. For example, ‐360° , ‐270° , ‐180° , ‐90° , 0 ° , 90 ° , 180 ° , 270 ° , 360 ° are quadrantal angles.
A. sec(-x) = - sec(x) B. the range of y = tan(x) is given by (0, + infinity) C. the period of y = -2 cos (3 Pi t) is equal to 2Pi / 3 D. the period of y = -5 tan (0.5 Pi t) is equal to 2. Solution. D. If y = a tan(bx) then period = Pi/ |b| = Pi / (0.5 Pi) = 2.Questions 18:oots: x = 1 and x = 4. Check answer: only x = 1 is a solution since the given equation is not defined at x = 4. Questions 9: If the domain of function f given by f(x) = -x + 6x is given by the interval [0, 6], then the range of f is given by the interval. Solution. We first note that the zeros of f are x = 0 and x = 6.
Any right triangle with the same-length hypotenuse will have its far end lying on this circle. We already know that cos(60°) = 1/2. Now you can read this value from the drawing in the quadrants. The cosine ratio had been adjacent over hypotenuse; now it is  x over r .But the value is still 1/2. So we've set up the angle in the first quadrant, thrown away the triangle, and still been able to find the trig ratio.et's start with an equilateral triangle with sides of length 2 : Each angle of this triangle measures 60° . Then let's drop the perpendicular, splitting the triangle into two 30-60-90 triangles: We'll work with that 60° angle, as labelled.
16. 30. Using similar triangles, show that the values of the six trigonometric functions in Definition 2.1 depend only on the angle θ and not on the choice of the point (x, y) on the terminal side of θ. 31. In each case, assume that θ is an angle in standard position and find the quadrant in which it lies.s Figure 2b shows, an angle of ‐187° is a quadrant II angle. If the terminal side of an angle in standard position lies along either the x axis or the y axis, then the angle is called quadrantal. For example, ‐360° , ‐270° , ‐180° , ‐90° , 0 ° , 90 ° , 180 ° , 270 ° , 360 ° are quadrantal angles.
Therefore, x = 2 · cos (−60°) = 2 · cos 60° = 2 · ½ = 1. y = 2 · sin (−60°) = 2(−sin 60°) = 2(−½) = − . Proof of the main theorem. A function of any angle will equal plus or minus that same function. of the corresponding acute angle.The sign will depend on the quadrant.he corresponding acute angle of 135° is 45°. In the second quadrant, the cosine is negative and the sine is positive. Therefore, x = r cos θ = 1 · cos 135° = −cos 45° = −½ .

Creatures Of Skull Island.
King Kong (1933 film) King Kong is a 1933 American pre-Code monster adventure film directed and produced by Merian C. Cooper and Ernest B. Schoedsack. The screenplay by James Ashmore Creelman and Ruth Rose was from an idea conceived by Cooper and Edgar Wallace.
With King Kong's success, a sequel was inevitable. The Son of Kong, released later in 1933, brought back Robert Armstrong as Carl Denham, who returns to Kong's Skull Island home to find a kinder, gentler version of the giant ape. The film was not as successful as the original.
Kong in Love. The sexual politics of Peter Jackson's King Kong. Click here to read David Edelstein's review of Peter Jackson's King Kong. If you're Peter Jackson remaking King Kong(1933), the first question is how to make a more plausible ape. The second is how to offer up a more plausible sexual politics—an update to Cooper's archetype of a blond damsel in distress menaced by a powerful, chest-pounding simian.
This is basically correct, I think,” says John Hutchinson, a researcher at the University of London’s Royal Veterinary College, who studies how very large animals stand and move. In the movie, Kong appears to be about 25 feet tall in a crouch–about seven times the height of an actual silverback gorilla.

The Biology Of King Kong. In the world of movie monsters, no creature stands as tall as King Kong. Sure, at just 25 feet in height, this gorilla may not be the biggest beast in the jungle. But more than 70 years after his classic film debut, Kong has reached a legendary status that few other film characters can even hope to attain.
King Kong opened March 2, 1933, at both of RKO's flagship theatres in New York -- the Radio City Music Hall and the Roxy. It was the first film to open at both theaters at once. King Kong took in more than $100,000 during its first week, the biggest movie opening to that time.

Betelgeuse ('the red giant), Rigel and Bellatrix are some other well known stars in the Orion Constellation. Another famous phenomenon in the Orion constellation is the Great Nebula, in which thousands of stars are being born. Orion is a pattern of stars that has intrigued mankind since ancient times. The word Orion may derive from the ancient Akkadian word 'Uru-anna,' which means 'The Light of Heaven.'
Orion, or The Hunter, is the name of a star constellation, easily located in the sky by the three bright stars in a row that make up The Hunter's Belt. Starting with the top one (in the Northern hemisphere), the names of these three stars are Mintaka, Alnilam and Alnitak. (According to Solara, their galactic names are EL, AN and RA).
Heaven is not pinpointed in the natural, so we cannot see where it is. We know it is the 3rd heaven where the throne of God is ( 2 Corinthians 12:2-4 ). The second heaven is the stars and planets, and the first heaven is the atmosphere around the earth. That is one of the key places. The Great Pyramid in Egypt was used as a gateway to travel to Orion. The other main culture worshiped by the Egyptains was the Sirian Star-Nation, known as the Dogon Tribe. They inspired many of the tales in the bible.

Classpath is a parameter—set either on the command-line, or through an environment variable —that tells the Java Virtual Machine or the Java compiler where to look for user-defined classes and packages.imilar to the classic dynamic loading behavior, when executing Java programs, the Java Virtual Machine finds and loads classes lazily (it loads the bytecode of a class only when the class is first used).
The default class path is the current directory. Setting the CLASSPATH variable or using the-classpath command-line option overrides that default, so if you want to include the current directory in the search path, you must include  . in the new settings.he runtime tool java has a-cp option, as well. This option is an abbreviation for-classpath. For very special cases, both java and javac have options that let you change the path they use to find their own class libraries.

The CLASSPATH tells the Java Virtual Machine and other Java applications and tools where to find the class libraries. The class libraries that the CLASSPATH points to may be the JDK classes (contained in the classes.zip file in the lib folder) and/or any classes that you want to use.
In this case you can set your Java classpath in the META-INF/MANIFEST.MF file by using the Class-Path attribute. In short Class-path attribute in manifest file overrides classpath specified by-cp, -classpath or CLASSPATH environment variable.hen you use the-jar command line option to run your program as an executable JAR, then the Java CLASSPATH environment variable will be ignored, and also the-cp and-classpath switches will be ignored and In this case you can set your java classpath in the META-INF/MANIFEST.MF file by using the Class-Path attribute.
The CLASSPATH environment variable is set with the set command. Using set at the DOS prompt changes the current value of CLASSPATH. You can also use set in your startup file to specify a CLASSPATH at startup.The format is: where a path to a .zip or .jar file must terminate with the filename, and a path to a .class file must terminate with the directory name.

Daniel Mowrey recommends: Taken by itself, one 300 mg capsule at each meal or at two of three meals per day is sufficient. Combined with other herbs anywhere from 50 mg to 150 mg is sufficient. (28) Dr. Dukes recommendation on how to take it and how much is as follows: Im all for enjoying turmeric in fabulous food.
A tablespoon seems alot. I'd put that much in my meatloaf recipe, which gives about 10 portions - any more and the recipe becomes too turmeric. Sounds like you're supplementing with the spice, rather than just making it a normal part of your diet.
The recommended dosage for curcumin as an anti-inflammatory is 400 to 600 milligrams three times per day. To achieve a similar amount of curcumin in the form of turmeric would require a dosage of 8,000 to 60,000 milligrams three times a day.
Most days, I use it several times a day. When I noticed that my turmeric ginger tea eliminated 98% of my allergy symptoms during peak allergy season, I was sold. Here are 10 reasons why you should be using turmeric every day! Turmeric is an anti-microbial.
I don't know how much turmeric is too much. But I can tell you that I've been taking turmeric every day, 1 or 2 teaspoons. I put it in my morning scrambled eggs and on potatoes, carrots and pumpkins. I also use ginger and cinnamon.
How Much Turmeric For Cancer. Week 1: Start with a small dosage of 1 gram of curcumin per day. If you see no side effects, take it for a week and proceed to dosage of week 2. Week 2: Increase the dosage of curcumin to 2 grams/ day. Again check for any issues side effects etc.
Jun 04, 2011 - 2:00 pm. June 4, 2011 - 1:51pm. A lot of you are asking how to use turmeric or what curcumin to take. I'd like to share what I've learned about that subject from several books and online research.
I think folks may be getting gm (grams) and mg (micrograms) mixed up. Turmeric's effect start from the lowest dosage 1mg (a teaspoon of turmeric is roughly 2,270 mg. (Aqua-calc.com is a wonderful site for converting measurements).. So one teaspoon of turmeric would give you a dose of roughly 2.27 grams of turmeric.
Daniel Mowrey recommends: Taken by itself, one 300 mg capsule at each meal or at two of three meals per day is sufficient. Combined with other herbs anywhere from 50 mg to 150 mg is sufficient.

The cell membrane, or plasma membrane, surrounds and protects the internal environment of a cell; however, this is not its only function. A cell membrane also determines what materials enter or leave the cell. This ensures that the cells will be able to get rid of wastes and take up important nutrients and gases.
Phospholipids make up the basic structure of a cell membrane. A single phospholipid molecule has two different ends: a head and a tail. The head end contains a phosphate group and is hydrophilic. This means that it likes or is attracted to water molecules.
See full infographic: JPG | PDF When we see the intricacy of intracellular structures and the diversity of whole-cell shapes, we immediately ask what genes or proteins might sculpt these complex features. In some cases, proteins have indeed been found whose function seems to determine the shape of organelles.
Growth of plant cells is thus a complex interaction between the internal, turgor-generated hydrostatic pressure and the surrounding cell wall. The driving force of cell wall deformation, the turgor pressure, is a non-vectorial force.
In a spherical organelle, the surface area-to-volume ratio is a function of organelle size, and no matter what genes a cell might express, it can’t vary the surface area and volume independently without changing the shape or the surface area-to-volume ratio.
The fluid mosaic model describes the structure of a cell membrane. It indicates that the cell membrane is not solid. It is flexible and has a similar consistency to vegetable oil, so all the individual molecules are just floating in a fluid medium, and they are all capable of moving sideways within the cell membrane.
Understanding cellular geometry will require a systems-level approach to determine how the separate behaviors of multiple parts give rise to the function of the entire system. CELLULAR DIVERSITY: Cells of different tissues and organisms exhibit an array of dramatically different shapes and sizes.
This is quite a hard to answer question. There are different cell cycle molecules that, if mutated or knocked out, have shown to cause the cell to have a different shape or overgrow in size or not grow at all... You might find some insight here. There are lots of factors that influence cell size and shape, thus it is a very complex system to study. For example, cell shape is influenced by the cytoskeleton but also other factors.
[1] Morphogenesis of complex plant cell shapes-the mechanical role of crystalline cellulose in growing pollen tubes. Aouar L, Chebli Y, Geitmann A. 2010. Sexual Plant Reproduction 23: 15–27. [2] How to shape a cylinder: pollen tube as a model system for the generation of complex cellular geometry.
A recent study of the ER, which takes the shape of a stack of pancakes, illustrates how these different factors can work together. A substantial fraction of the ER consists of flat membranous sacs, and in order to fit a large surface area into a small cell, these sacs are stacked one on top of another. Specific proteins play a role in arranging the flat shape of the stacks.

What do employers do when employees provide too much notice of resignation? June 2, 2011 Stuart Rudner, Rudner Law Employment/Labour Standards, Human Resources An oft-overlooked issue is the amount of notice that employees must give their employer when they leave. According to Sure-Grip Fasteners Ltd. v. Allgrade Bolt & Chain Inc. (1993), 45 C.C.E.L. 276 (Ontario General Division), “an employee is obligated by law to give reasonable notice of termination to his or her employer. The main purpose of the notice of resignation is to allow the employer a reasonable time to find a replacement.”
An employer must give: 1  8 weeks' notice if the employment of 50 to 199 employees is to be terminated. 2  12 weeks' notice if the employment of 200 to 499 employees is to be terminated. 3  16 weeks' notice if the employment of 500 or more employees is to be terminated.
The Act also covers employment loss for 50-499 employees if they make up at least 33% of the employer's active workforce. In a layoff situation that is not covered by the WARN Act, the employer is not required by Federal law to give any notice. Situations vary. If the reason for the layoff is economic, employees will usually experience immediate employment termination.
Labor Law: Is there any regulation behind how much notice an employer must give an employee of their scheduled hours? (Illinois)
Termination of employment is one of the most significant areas of employment law. Usually, the analysis. of a termination begins with an examination of whether there is “cause” for the termination, followed by. an assessment of the employer’s obligations in connection with the termination.
Reasonable Notice of Resignation Many people think an employee is required to provide two weeks notice of resignation by law. However, neither the Ontario government nor the Ontario courts have made this a legal requirement.
As an example, the Ontario ESA sets out the following minimum standards: 1  termination of employment (a formula is applied based on years of service); maximum hours of work (48 hours per week); 2  minimum wage ($11.00 per hour); 3  public holidays (9 days); 4  paid vacations (2 weeks per year);
09/26/2014|employmentlawtoday.com|Last Updated: 09/26/2014. An Ontario court has determined that an employee who is considering retirement may not be entitled to as much notice of dismissal as an employee who will look for other work. As is commonly known, an employee that is terminated without cause is entitled to notice of termination or pay in lieu of such notice.
As well, there are notice provisions regarding statutory leaves, including that, if you're not coming back after parental leave, you have to give at least 4 weeks' notice. And there's one which, while not a strict requirement, is a good idea: When an employee has received notice of termination and is entitled to statutory severance pay, and the employee wants to leave before the end of the statutory notice period, the employee can preserve the right to statutory severance by ...
OK There is no law that deals with this. But it is best to have a provision in their contract that deals with this. The reason why is you don't want an long-time employee to say that a shift change forced them to quit and allege constructive dismissal.
A New Way to Diagnose Depression? A urine test can detect pyrrole depression, while blood testing can identify the other biotypes. Walsh said a physician-training program is in place to expand the testing throughout the world. Last month, 66 doctors from Australia were trained in the approach, and training for U.S. physicians will take place in October.
And he says all can easily be diagnosed with blood or urine tests. A researcher says he has identified multiple types of depression, including three that don't involve serotonin. And he says all can easily be diagnosed with blood or urine tests.
The first blood test to diagnose major depression in adults has been developed, providing the first objective, scientific diagnosis for depression. The test also predicts who will benefit from cognitive behavioral therapy, offering the opportunity for more effective, individualized therapy.
This study clearly indicates that you can have a blood-based laboratory test for depression, providing a scientific diagnosis in the same way someone is diagnosed with high blood pressure or high cholesterol, said Eva Redei, who developed the test and is a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine.
This study brings us much closer to having laboratory tests that can be used in diagnosis and treatment selection. The new blood test will allow physicians for the first time to use lab tests to determine what treatments will be most useful for individual patients.

From the earlier form je-quoll, from Guugu Yimidhirr dhigul. Recorded by Banks (quote below) but then virtually forgotten for 150 years, with the term native cat used instead. Today readopted and gaining in popularity.
Noun[edit] quoll ‎(plural quolls) Any of the various carnivorous marsupials of the genus Dasyurus found in Australia and New Guinea, roughly the size of a cat.
Noun[edit] quoll ‎(plural quolls) 1  Any of the various carnivorous marsupials of the genus Dasyurus found in Australia and New Guinea, roughly the size of a cat.  1770, Joseph Banks, The Endeavour Journal of Sir Joseph Banks, extended description following entry for 26 August 1770 [1]
AWC ecologists monitor populations of the Northern Quoll on Brooklyn and in the Kimberley, and conduct a number of research projects aimed at better understanding the conservation requirements of the species.
AWC protects three populations of Northern Quoll and their habitat on a number of our northern sanctuaries. AWC works to reduce the impacts of cat predation by improving ground cover, by implementing fire management to reduce the frequency of extensive late season fires and by control of feral herbivores.
The spotted-tailed quoll is found along both sides of the Great Dividing Range from the Victorian to the Queensland borders. Scattered, unconfirmed records of the species have also been reported in the western parts of NSW.
Predation by feral cats is a major threat to Northern Quolls. The impacts of cats are exacerbated by extensive hot fires and grazing, which reduce ground cover and hence shelter for small mammals. Northern Quolls are also especially vulnerable to being poisoned by cane toads.
The spotted-tailed quoll, or tiger quoll, is mainland Australia's largest carnivorous marsupial. It is about the size of a domestic cat, but has shorter legs and a more pointed face than a cat. Its fur is rich red to dark brown, and covered with white spots on the back which continue down the tail. The spotted tail distinguishes it from all other Australian mammals, including other quoll species. However, the spots may be indistinct on young animals. The average weight of an adult male is about 3,500 grams and an adult female about 2,000 grams.
The Northern Quoll is the smallest of the four Australian quoll species with a body length of 249 - 370 mm, a tail length of 202 - 345 mm, and weight of 240 - 1120 g. It has reddish brown fur, with a cream underside, white spots on its back and rump, a blackish tail and a pointed snout.
Spotted-tailed quoll description. The spotted-tailed quoll (Dasyurus maculatus) is a well-adapted carnivore and one of the most ferocious animals in the Australian bush . It has a physically strong body and strong teeth for slicing meat off its mammalian prey and crushing invertebrates . Of the six species of quolls, the spotted-tailed quoll is the largest, with males growing to almost a meter from head to tail .

In building construction, a plenum (pronounced PLEH-nuhm, from Latin meaning full) is a separate space provided for air circulation for heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (sometimes referred to as HVAC) and typically provided in the space between the structural ceiling and a drop-down ceiling.n buildings with computer installations, the plenum space is often used to house connecting communication cables. Because ordinary cable introduces a toxic hazard in the event of fire, special plenum cabling is required in plenum areas.
So after you choose fiber or copper, Category 5 or Category 5e, you still have another decision to make. It may seem like a minor one, but it is important nonetheless since plenum and non-plenum are so different. In this corner. Plenum-rated cable gets its name from an HVAC term—plenum spaces.The plenum spaces are those that lie between a drop and standard ceiling (or a similar version in the floor space) and it is this section where the air in a building circulates, thus aiding in heating and cooling functions.o after you choose fiber or copper, Category 5 or Category 5e, you still have another decision to make.

When both the supply and return ducts are constructed in this manner, it is possible to insulate the ducts and the dropped ceiling so that the upper airspace is not heated or cooled, increasing energy efficiency.
A forced-air HVAC system distributes conditioned air through a plenum. A household forced-air heating, ventilation and air conditioning system depends on a system of ducts to provide a controlled path for distributing heated or cooled air throughout the home.he HVAC equipment has a blower that forces heated or cooled air into the supply plenum and from the plenum into the rooms through the supply duct system. Air-cleaning filters may be located in the supply plenum.
Return Plenum. Forced-air systems also have return ducts that connect to the HVAC equipment through an air-collection box known as a return plenum. As freshly conditioned air is blown out of the room supply ducts, “used” air from the rooms is sucked into the return ducts.he HVAC equipment has a blower that forces heated or cooled air into the supply plenum and from the plenum into the rooms through the supply duct system.

Return air plenums are the ducting units used as the central chamber for return air ducting. Furnaces and air handlers should have a return air plenum so that they can operate at their maximum efficiency.Return air plenums recycle the air in a structure back to the air handling unit and exhaust the air out of the home.enerally, a return air plenum will cost approximately $50 to $60 per unit. The other costs to consider are those for the labor and materials needed to install the return air plenum. The installation takes an average of about five hours with the sum of labor costs between $290 and $370.

Your hvac duct system is the heart of your home's heating and cooling system. Without a healthy system you could be wasting a lot of money. Like the human body, if the heart isn't healthy you are in trouble. A duct system provides a controlled path for air flow throughout the home.he two main types of supply systems are extended plenum and central plenum. A central plenum system is a system where all of the branch ducts start at the same location called a plenum. The extended plenum system consists of a supply air plenum which is connected to the outlet of the hvac equipment.

We are in the same boat. Mine are a totally different color than yours, but they aren’t green, blue, gray, or brown. They “change colors”, as people say are characteristic for hazel. But even if they didn’t, there’s never a distinct color. I go with hazel. Yours have a distinct green color in the picture you uploaded.
Quite beautiful. As for the second question, Green and Hazel eyes are a couple of the rarer eye colors with Hazel being 5–8% and Green being 2% ( Eye Color Guide - The Most Common Eye Colors) and there are a number of variations that it can depend on.
All blue eyes are not created equal because eye color is determined by many different gene combinations, as seen in the image below: The colored part of the eye is called the iris. The iris has pigmentation that determines the eye color. Irises are classified as being one of six colors: amber, blue, brown, gray, green, hazel, or red. Often confused with hazel eyes, amber eyes tend to be a solid golden or copper color without flecks of blue or green typical of hazel eyes.

The colored part of the eye is called the iris, which has pigmentation that determines our eye color. Her eyes may be blue only temporarily; babies' eyes can change color if the brown pigment melanin develops as they grow. Human eye color originates with three genes, two of which are well understood. These genes account for the most common colors — green, brown, and blue. Other colors, such as gray, hazel and multiple combinations are not fully understood or explainable at this time.
Having rings around your pupils that are a different color is called Heterochromia iridum – specifically, central heterochromia. It’s usually caused by a (non harmful, as far as I know) genetic deficiency. This is really commonly confused with hazel, since both can be described as “multicolored eyes”.
Hazel eyes appear to change color between green and brown, depending on the light. They will often times be a different shade around the pupil, but not always. So, if your eyes are always green with brown rings, you have green eyes with central heterochromia.

Your eyes are not hazel. They are dark green and hazel. Hazel is one specific color, not a mix of eye colors. Hazel is a light brown color, like the nut. I don’t get why light blue-green eyes are always called green, while darker green eyes with other colors are always labelled hazel. Your eyes are a beautiful color whatever people call them.
Green is the least common eye color, but it is found most frequently in northern and central Europe. I have always incorrectly called this color eye hazel! Hazel eyes mostly consist of shades of brown and green. Much like gray eyes, hazel eyes may appear to “change color” from green to light brown to gold. Individuals whose eyes appear to be one color closest to the pupil, another color a little farther our, and another color around the edge of the iris are likely to have hazel eyes.
Immigration Reform & What It Means for Immigrants Now. Immigration Reform & What It Means for Immigrants Now. President Obama's announcement to stop the deportation of some undocumented immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as youths, sent ripples through many sectors of government from politicians to immigration law attorneys.
The White House claims that over 5 million immigrants could be eligible for the new and expanded statuses, out of an estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the United States. Immigrants cannot yet apply for DAPA or the expanded DACA.
Immigrant rights activists are assessing the new presidential executive order and what’s next in the fight for immigrant rights. Photo: Light Brigading, CC BY-NC 2.0. Responding to years of pressure from immigrant activists, President Obama took executive action on November 20 (see box below for details). We interviewed two activists about the executive order and what’s next in the fight for immigrant rights.
But because of the court’s earlier decisions, everything has to be stuffed into the “diversity” box. So universities say they want to advance diversity but never explain what they mean (nor did the court, in its earlier decisions and in its decision Thursday). This is fodder for the critics like Alito.
Immigration law refers to national government policies controlling the immigration and deportation of people, and other matters such as citizenship. Immigration laws vary from country to country, as well as according to the political climate of the times, as sentiments may sway from the widely inclusive to the deeply exclusive of new immigrants.
Immigration Reform & What It Means for Immigrants Now. by Michelle Fabio, Esq., September 2012. President Obama's announcement to stop the deportation of some undocumented immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as youths, sent ripples through many sectors of government from politicians to immigration law attorneys.
Immigration law regarding the citizens of a country is regulated by international law. The United Nations International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights mandates that all countries allow entry to its own citizens.
Any references below to USCIS refer to the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services. An individual who is not a U.S. citizen or U.S. national. An individual who owes his sole allegiance to the United States, including all U.S. citizens, and including some individuals who are not U.S. citizens.
Let’s start with immigration: In this odd term of only eight justices, the court has weighed in on United States v. Texas with a 4-4 split and an unsatisfying one-line affirmance of the lower court to deny deportation relief to as many as five million immigrants who could have applied for it.
Immigration Law and Legal Definition. Federal immigration law determines whether a person is an alien, and associated legal rights, duties, and obligations of aliens in the United states. It also provides means by which certain aliens can become naturalized citizens with full rights of citizenship. Immigration law determines who may enter, how long they may stay and when they must leave. The main legislation governing immigration is the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, (INA).
As their scientific name Allium proliferum states, these hardy little onions are very prolific.. After planting them in your garden you will have onions every year for years to come! Egyptian Walking Onions are also called Tree Onions, Egyptian Tree Onions, Top Onions, Winter Onions, or Perennial Onions..
Onion is a term used for many plants in the genus allium. They are known by the common name onion but, used without qualifiers, it usually refers to Allium cepa. Allium cepa is also known as the garden onion or bulb onion.
To indicate that it is indeed a small onion, it is called a pearl, but there are also other members of the onion family with the names of shallots, rampion, scallions or simply baby onions.
Chives are a bunched plant that the green slender stalks are cut and used as an herb. The stalks are usually the size of a spaghetti. Green onions are also called scallions, and the stalks are much larger and the bulbs of the plant are included when offered for sale.

The stalks are usually the size of a spaghetti. Green onions are also called scallions, and the stalks are much larger and the bulbs of the plant are included when offered for sale. You can substitute green onion tops for chives, just use the smaller, younger green parts and dice finely.
Green Onions vs. Scallions. A green onion can be classified as a type of scallion. Both can be used interchangeably. True scallions are identified by the fact that the sides of the base are straight, whereas the green onion is usually slightly curved, showing the beginnings of a bulb.

Also known as baby onions or button onions, pearl onions are a variety of tree onion, often used for pickling as cocktail onions. Pearl onions are also used in recipes like succotash and onion relish because of their sweet, mild flavor and their attractive, diminutive size.
Scallion, green onion, and spring onion are English names (with many other regional names throughout the world) for various Allium species. All of the Allium have hollow green leaves (like the common onion), but these are used while they lack a fully developed root bulb.
10-inches thick - covers 32 square feet. 12-inches thick - covers 27 square feet. For example, let's calculate how much concrete is needed for a 5-inch thick rectangular driveway, 60-feet long (length) and 18-feet wide (width). The area of the driveway is 1,080 square feet (60-feet x 18-feet).
Ft To Yards Of Concrete. To convert cubic feet to cubic yards, divide by 27. 3'x3'x3' = 27 cubic feet =1 cubic yard. Now, having said all that, if this is the first time you're ordering concrete, you might want to get someone with some experience in to help and double check your numbers.
EXAMPLE: 18 FEET LONG, 18 FEET WIDE, 6 INCHES DEEP. THIS WOULD BE: (18 X 18 X .5)/27 = 6 CU.YARDS. To use the Concrete Volume Calculator, simply enter the width, length, and thickness of your pour, click on whether you are measuring the thickness in feet or inches, then click on the Calculate button.
One Cubic Yard of Concrete: 1  4-inches thick – covers 81 square feet. 2  5-inches thick – covers 65 square feet. 3  6-inches thick – covers 54 square feet.  7-inches thick – covers 46 square 1  feet. 8-inches thick – covers 41 square feet.  10-inches thick – covers 32 square 1  feet. 12-inches thick – covers 27 square  feet.
Re: Conversion For Sq. Ft To Yards Of Concrete. Area = length x width. Volume = length x width x height (or depth of concrete) To convert cubic feet to cubic yards, divide by 27. One yard = 3 feet. 3'x3'x3' = 27 cubic feet =1 cubic yard.
How many Sq feet does a single bag of Quikcrete cover? A 60 lb. bag of QUIKRETE Concrete Mix yields approximately 0.45 cubic feet of concrete. If applied 4&rdquo; thick, which is the typical depth for a slab, a 60 lb bag will roughly cover 1.35 cubic feet. Yields are approximate and will vary based upon waste, uneven sub-grade, etc.
THIS WOULD BE: (18 X 18 X .5)/27 = 6 CU.YARDS. 1  To use the Concrete Volume Calculator, simply enter the width, length, and thickness of your pour, click on whether you are measuring the thickness in feet or inches, then click on the Calculate button. The calculator will estimate the number of cubic yards of concrete that will be required.
For example, let’s calculate how much concrete is needed for a 5-inch thick rectangular driveway, 60-feet long (length) and 18-feet wide (width). The area of the driveway is 1,080 square feet (60-feet x 18-feet). According to the table above, one cubic yard of concrete placed at a thickness of 5-inches covers 65 square feet. In a perfect universe, our 1,080 square foot driveway will need exactly 16.62 cubic yards of concrete (1,080 square feet / 65 square feet equals 16.62 cubic yards).
Assuming you are talking about a cubic yard of concrete then this will cover 81 square feet to a depth of 4 inches. This is how you work it out. A yard is 3 feet. so a square yard (3 feet by 3 feet) is 9 square feet. There are also 12 inches in a foot and 3 feet in a yard, which makes the cubic yard of concrete 36 inches high.
According to the table above, one cubic yard of concrete placed at a thickness of 5-inches covers 65 square feet. In a perfect universe, our 1,080 square foot driveway will need exactly 16.62 cubic yards of concrete (1,080 square feet / 65 square feet equals 16.62 cubic yards).

The root cause of psychological erectile dysfunction symptoms can vary. Sometimes it’s external stress, such as work or family, or internal stress stemming from a lack of sexual self-confidence. Identifying symptoms caused by psychological factors are done by analyzing current mental symptoms.
The onset and progression of erectile dysfunction symptoms may continue for months, or years, without causing true concern. That is, until erectile dysfunction symptoms move from an occasional dip in erection strength to a noticeable lack of desire or inability to sustain an erection throughout a sexual encounter. Uncovering the symptoms of ED is the first step to understand its root cause, and subsequent treatment.
In general, erectile dysfunction symptoms caused by prescription or OTC medications appear suddenly. The most common erectile dysfunction symptoms include: Complete Loss of Erections – The sudden onset of erectile dysfunction symptoms after starting a new medication is a clear indicator of medicine-induced ED.
Transient Symptoms – Throughout the course of life, a fleeting dip in male sexual function is perfectly normal. All men, regardless of health and age, experience erection problems. It’s only when these periodic bouts increases in frequency and severity that erectile dysfunction should be considered.
It is also important to remember that in both men and women with diabetes sexual dysfunction may occur temporarily due to elevated blood sugar and may not be a permanent issue, simply one that can be remedied by close management of blood sugar levels.
The NIH states women with diabetes commonly experience sexual dysfunction. The cause for these problems in women include nerve damage (neuropathy), decreased blood flow to genital and vaginal areas as well as hormone changes.
Men with diabetes tend to develop erectile dysfunction 10 to 15 years earlier than men without diabetes. As men with diabetes age, erectile dysfunction becomes even more common. Above the age of 50, the likelihood of having difficulty with an erection occurs in approximately 50% to 60% of men with diabetes. Above age 70, there is about a 95% likelihood of having some difficulty with erectile dysfunction.
One of the best things to do to avoid or manage sexual dysfunction if you have diabetes is to manage your blood sugar levels as best as possible. Prolonged high blood sugar levels damage nerves and delicate blood vessels over time.
The causes of erectile dysfunction in men with diabetes are complex and involve impairments in nerve, blood vessel, and muscle function. To get an erection, men need healthy blood vessels, nerves, male hormones, and a desire to be sexually stimulated.
Diabetes and Erectile Dysfunction. Diabetes can cause erectile dysfunction. Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a common problem amongst men who have diabetes affecting 35-75% of male diabetics. Up to 75% of men suffering from diabetes will experience some degree of erectile dysfunction (erection problems) over the course of their lifetime. Men who have diabetes are thought to develop erectile dysfunction between 10 and 15 years earlier than men who do not suffer from the disease. Over the age of 70, there is a 95% likelihood of facing difficulties with erectile function.

Explain how Jazz evolved. Jazz began from African roots where it developed from aural traditions. When slavery began in North America, this began to the rise of Blues. People began to express their sorrow and emotions through music. Early Jazz at this time was heavily improvised. This was pioneered by Louis Armstrong. At this time the culture of Jazz began to change. Head cutting became more evident and allowed the first sense of competition to come into play. Jazz became more popular with the invention of recording music. This allowed the music to become more accessible and spread across the nation into Chicago then NYC.
In Philadelphia, Gillespie began playing trumpet with local bands, learning all of his idol Eldridge's solos from records and radio broadcasts: it was in Philadelphia that he picked up his nickname of Dizzy.. In 1937, Dizzy moved to New York and replaced Eldridge in Teddy Hill's Orchestra.
Roy Hodgeson played for Crystal Palace as a youth team player, but was never able to break into the first team. He then played for Tonbridge Angels, Gravesend & Northfleet, Ma … idstone United, Ashford Town, Berea Park (from South Africa), and Carshalton Athletic.
Young Gillespie, then 13, loved Eldridge's playing and the entire band. From that day on, he dreamed of becoming a jazz musician. In 1933, after graduating from Robert Smalls secondary school, Gillespie received a music scholarship to attend Laurinburg Institute, in North Carolina.

Conversely, a low TSH reflects either a low need or desire for thyroid hormone or a low tolerance for the thyroid hormone and is meant to reduce thyroid hormone production. An optimal value of TSH means the thyroid hormone levels match the body’s energy needs and/or ability to utilize the energy.
TSH: Is a hormone produced by the pituitary gland and whose function is to signal the thyroid gland to make more thyroid hormone. It represents the pituitary's need or desire for more thyroid hormone (T4 or T3).
Thyroid levels are a critical component of determining the cause of low metabolic energy. The Thyroid Scale™ helps us compare thyroid lab values to each other and thus see their implications more clearly. It can be a line diagram or a table of lab values to visually depict how TSH, T4, and T3 relate to each other.
Thyroid hormones: The thyroid gland makes a hormone called T4 (thyroxine). T4 will become T3 (triiodothyronine) which causes energy (in the form of ATP) to be made in each living cell, or Reverse T3 (RT3) which interferes with the energy production in the cell.
If you’re making too much thyroid hormone, your TSH will go down.”. What’s normal can vary, depending on a number of factors, including the laboratory where your blood test is done, she adds. A normal range for TSH in most laboratories is 0.4 milliunits per liter (mU/L) to 4.0 mU/L.
A simple regular blood test is used to guide treatment for hypothyroidism and monitor the condition. Here's what the numbers mean. If there’s a bright side to hypothyroidism, or an underactive thyroid, it’s that treatment usually just involves taking daily medication, and testing is limited to a simple blood test.
Only T4 that is unattached or “free” can get into your cells to go to work. A blood test can measure how much free T4 is available. Hypothyroidism is treated with daily medication. Taking synthetic thyroid hormone medication can bring your T4 and TSH levels back to their normal ranges.
That’s why some women with low thyroid can have weight gain even when they severely restrict calories. In order to fix your metabolism, you have to understand your entire health picture, not just your thyroid.
The thyroid and weight gain. Because patients with an underactive thyroid tend to have a very low basal metabolic rate, one of the most noticeable symptoms of hypothyroidism is weight gain and difficulty losing extra weight. (Sometimes an overactive thyroid can mimic an underactive thyroid by causing weight gain, although this is less common).
It makes thyroid-stimulating hormone, or TSH, which tells the thyroid gland how much T4 and T3 to produce. The TSH level in your blood reveals how much T4 your pituitary gland is asking your thyroid gland to make. If your TSH levels are abnormally high, it could mean you have an underactive thyroid, or hypothyroidism.

In bacteria, all transcription is performed by a single type of RNA polymerase. This polymerase contains four catalytic subunits and a single regulatory subunit known as sigma (s). Interestingly, several distinct sigma factors have been identified, and each of these oversees transcription of a unique set of genes.
Transcription initiation on protein-encoding genes represents a major control point for gene expression in eukaryotes, and is mediated by RNA polymerase II and a surprisingly complex array of general initiation factors (TFIIA, -B, -D, -E, -F and-H) that are highly conserved from yeast to man.
All eukaryotes have three different RNA polymerases (RNAPs) which transcribe different types of genes. RNA polymerase I transcribes rRNA genes, RNA polymerase II transcribes mRNA, miRNA, snRNA, and snoRNA genes, and RNA polymerase III transcribes tRNA and 5S rRNA genes.
Abstract. All eukaryotes have three different RNA polymerases (RNAPs) which transcribe different types of genes. RNA polymerase I transcribes rRNA genes, RNA polymerase II transcribes mRNA, miRNA, snRNA, and snoRNA genes, and RNA polymerase III transcribes tRNA and 5S rRNA genes.
Eukaryotic cells are more complex than bacteria in many ways, including in terms of transcription. Specifically, in eukaryotes, transcription is achieved by three different types of RNA polymerase (RNA pol I-III).
For example, researchers know that RNA pol II can bind to a DNA sequence within the promoter of many genes, known as the TATA box, to initiate transcription. Together with other common motifs (short recognition sequences in the DNA), these elements constitute the core promoter.
For example, researchers know that RNA pol II can bind to a DNA sequence within the promoter of many genes, known as the TATA box, to initiate transcription.
Recruitment of RNA Polymerase II to the Promoter: Eukaryotes do not have a simple protein that corresponds to the s factor in prokaryotes. Rather, there is a set of proteins that together perform the same function as the s factor, and these are the general transcription factors (GTFs).
In all species, transcription begins with the binding of the RNA polymerase complex (or holoenzyme) to a special DNA sequence at the beginning of the gene known as the promoter.

But now that you've seen the actual results, you can see this simply isn't true. Januvia and glipizide failed for 54% of those who tried them over two years and over one years far more people found it worthless compared to those who tried glipizide. The impact on blood sugar was functionally insignificant for both.
This medication is usually used to treat diabetes. Some of the most prescribed drugs in this class include: Januvia. The most affordable medications in this class include: The information provided on DrugPriceInfo.com is intended to supplement, not substitute for, the expertise and judgment of healthcare professionals.
If you do not have insurance then you may need to purchase the medication at full price. The cost for Januvia in the United States is typically close to $600 for ninety pills and $400 for sixty pills. This cost can vary depending on the pharmacy where you purchase your medication. Typically, places such as Costco will have Januvia for slightly less than places such as CVS.
Given that Januvia costs $190 a month and glipizide costs $4 a month (on many pharmacy generic drug savings plans) it's worth taking a closer look at the statistics. Safety and Efficacy of Treatment with Sitagliptin or Glipizide in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Inadequately Controlled on Metformin: A 2-year Study.
This medication is a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, prescribed for type 2 diabetes (condition in which the body does not use insulin normally and therefore cannot control the amount of sugar in the blood), particularly in people whose diabetes cannot be controlled by diet alone.
Bottom Line: The abstract of this study will be used by Merck sales reps to convince doctors that Januvia is far superior to glipizide for their patients because it causes weight loss and increases beta cell function.
The Januvia group lost an average of 3.5 pounds (starting from a baseline average weight of 194.7 lbs for the Januvia group.) The glipzide group gained an average of 1.54 pounds starting from an average of 198.7 pounds.) These weight changes are negligible in functional or for that matter, even cosmetic terms.
Januvia is one of the priciest diabetes medications on the market. It is used to help control type-2 diabetes. Januvia comes in three different dosages: 25mg, 50mg, and 100mg. Your insurance may cover it in full, or partially, which will help reduce the cost.

Recently Uber, Lyft and Sidecar began rolling out a new type of service that lets their customers share their rides with strangers picked up along the way to their destination, then split the fare. Each company has its own brand name—UberPool, Lyft Line and Sidecar’s Shared Rides—but essentially they work the same way.
So let’s break it down. First off, if you use Uber Black (limo, sedan or SUV), your rides to or from the airport are legal. That’s because Uber Black drivers are professional livery drivers licensed by the Public Utilities Commission for airport runs. UberTaxi drivers are also authorized to make airport runs.
“Under the law as it stands right now, I don’t see any liability on the part of a passenger for an UberX or Lyft ride to or from the airport,” said travel law attorney Adam Anolik of the Anolik Law Group in Sausalito, CA. “The issue really comes down to whether what Uber and Lyft are doing is illegal.
Uber rider says Denver cop called service illegal during stop. A Seattle man says the Uber car he was riding in was pulled over by a police officer who insisted the car service was illegal in Colorado, the first state to explicitly legalize the service. Post to Facebook.
New car-pool services sold by ride-sharing companies including Uber and Lyft are illegal in California, according to state regulators.
46 CONNECT 27 TWEET LINKEDIN 2 COMMENT EMAIL MORE. DENVER – A Seattle man says the Uber car he was riding in was pulled over by a police officer who insisted the car service was illegal in Colorado – even though it was actually the first state to explicitly legalize the service.
I have 2 questions for SFO involving Uber X. (1) Your quote of the Uber spokesperson is unclear. Newspaper articles have said it is illegal for Uber X drivers to take passengers to the airport, but you say that it is now ok for SOME Uber X drivers to go to the airport.
Right now, they’re only available in San Francisco. They may not be for long. This week the California Public Utilities Commission sent essentially the same warning letter to each of the companies, telling them that the new service violated state law.
Uber’s app for iOS. None of the companies approached the Public Utilities Commission before rolling out the services, according to Denise Tyrrell, director of the agency’s safety and enforcement division.
For example UberX and Lyft are currently legal in San Francisco, but illegal in Houston. The livery or “for hire” industry is generally regulated at the city level although a few states (CA, CO, GA) have passed state laws either supporting or outlawing TNCs (Transportation Network Companies).

For retirement, eligibility is at age 62. If a person reaches age 62 in 2015, for example, then 2015 is the person's year of eligibility. We always index an individual's earnings to the average wage level two years prior to the year of first eligibility.Thus, for a person retiring at age 62 in 2015, we would index the person's earnings to the average wage index for 2013, or 44,888.16.e would multiply earnings in a year before 2013 by the ratio of 44,888.16 to the average wage index for that year; we would take earnings in 2013 or later at face value.

One key measure is the real median level, meaning half of households have income above that level and half below, adjusted for inflation. According to the Federal Reserve, this measure was $51,939 in 2013, below the 1999 peak of around $57,000.ccording to the US Census Bureau persons with doctorates in the United States had an average income of roughly $81,400. The average for an advanced degree was $72,824 with men averaging $90,761 and women averaging $50,756 annually.
For the most part, Social Security was never supposed to be the sole source of retirement income. More of a starting point; and a very basic starting point at that.

8 than the average faculty salary. 8 While the average full-time faculty salary increased by only 10% over the last decade, the average salary for managers and supervisors increased by 24%.These differential changes have resulted in a widening gap between the salaries of faculty and administrators over the last decade.1 Changes in percentage are instructive, but they can actually understate the magnitude of the widening gap in actual salaries between campus presidents and CSU faculty over the last decade. A 10% increase in a salary of $50,000 is, after all, considerably less than a 10% increase in a salary of $300,000.

The label released Blondie's debut, also produced by Gottehrer, in December 1976. The group expanded its cult following to the West Coast with shows at L.A.'s Whisky-a-Go-Go in February 1977 and opened for Iggy Pop on a national tour.
Harry also did the rounds as a celebrity, including an endorsement of Gloria Vanderbilt designer jeans in 1980. As the group's success continued, there were reports that Stein and Harry were asserting more control. By 1981 some Blondie backing tracks were played by session musicians under Stein's direction. Burke produced the New York band Colors, and Destri released a solo album, Heart on a Wall, in 1982.

Like Rapture, it featured a white female vocalist doing a rap (Tina Weymouth). Like Blondie, Tom Tom Club was immersed in the New York music scene and influenced by hip-hop. Neither act knew the other was working on a rap song - Blondie was recording in New York while Tom Tom Club was working in the Bahamas.

In 2005, Rapture was mashed with The Doors' 1971 single Riders on the Storm into Rapture Riders by Go Home Productions. This unofficial mashup remix was later approved by both bands and released as a single credited to Blondie vs. The Doors.
Rapture is a song by the American pop rock band Blondie from their fifth studio album, Autoamerican (1980). In January 1981, Rapture was released as the second and final single from the album. The song reached No. 1 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart, where it stayed for two weeks. It was the first No. 1 song in the U.S. to feature rap. The song peaked at No. 4 in Australia and No. 5 in the United Kingdom.
The lyrics of this song are a bit apocalyptic, as the Man from Mars starts destroying the planet with his insatiable appetite. The word Rapture is also a play on the rap aspect of the song. As the age of disco ended, so did Blondie's success. This was their last US hit until 1999, when they had a comeback song called Maria.. They did have another UK hit in 1982 called Island Of Lost Souls.. If you listen carefully to the lyrics, you might hear something naughty.
Scotch Ales are strong ales, also known as Wee Heavy. In the 19th century Scotland, they'd also be known as 160/-, a nomenclature based on the now obsolete shilling currency. Scotch Ales traditionally go through a long boil in the kettle for a caramelization of the wort. This produces a deep copper to brown in colored brew.
Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy. Description: Scotch Ales are strong ales, also known as Wee Heavy..

Scotch Ales traditionally go through a long boil in the kettle for a caramelization of the wort.
Strong Scotch Ale is also known as 'Wee Heavy'. Examples of beers brewed in the USA under the name Wee Heavy tend to be 7% ABV and higher, while Scottish brewed examples, such as Belhaven's Wee Heavy can be found between 5.5% and 6.5% ABV. On the other hand, Scottish brewed exceptions include Traquair House Ale which is brewed to a strength of 7.2% ABV, and Traquair Jacobite Ale which is 8% ABV.
After that any beer billing itself with the term “Nitro” is a safe bet. The wide mouth at the top of the glass makes a beer’s creamy head and body that much more tantalizing. This glass also works well as a utility glass for any ales or lagers poured from a large bottle.
Scotch Ale/. Wee Heavy. Scotch Ale is also known as Wee Heavy, a name derived from the late 1800s when Scottish brewers commonly sold their strong ale in small 6-ounce “nips” or “wee” bottles. Scotch Ale is heavy and stronger than Scottish Ale in alcohol, is very malty and is fairly full-bodied, with color ranging from copper to dark brown with a tan head. Very rich malt aromas and flavors evoke a caramel, nutty character.
The Scotch Ale (or Wee Heavy) is a stronger version of the broader style of Scottish Ales. The style is very similar to a barleywine, with the exception that the characteristics lean heavily toward the malt profile. Hop presence should be minimal. Depending on the grains used, there can be a notable caramelized flavor present.
The tulip beer glass is similar in stature to the snifter but rather than ending at a taper, it flares out at the mouth. The flaring at the top of the glass can be relatively mild or rather pronounced depending on the glass maker.
What Beer Goes with a Thistle Glass? As mentioned, the thistle glass is designed to represent the Scottish thistle. That points us towards almost any beer listed as a Scotch Ale or Wee Heavy. Scotch Ales are stronger, dark ales which tend to be on the the sweet side so you could also experiment a bit with Dark Ales or Quads if you wanted to change things up a bit.

The delta symbol is used to represent change. Therefore, delta H represents the change in enthalpy of a system in a reaction.
Hydrofluoric Acid. It actually depends on if the HF has a aqeous or (aq) symbol behind it it it does than it is Hydrofluoric acid but if it doesn't then it is Hydrogen Fluoride. The chemical name for HF is hydrofluoric acid. Hydrofluoric acid is simply just a solution of hydrogen fluoride that is in water.

This is called an endothermic reaction. When enthalpy is negative and delta H is less than zero, this means that a system released heat. This is called an exothermic reaction. In chemistry, the system in question is the set of compounds in a reaction or process. Delta H describes whether this system absorbs or emits heat.

Best answer: It's not SUBJECTIVE how much 6.0221409e+23 atoms of hydrogen weigh. I you had 1e+24 atoms of hydrogen, you would find they'd weigh 1.65 grams, instead of 1.00 grams. That's WHY avogadro's number is what it is. It connects the atomic MASS of an atom with the WEIGHT in GRAMS of that many atoms of that type. So avogadro's number carbon 12 atoms, weighs 12 grams.

Calcium has an odd number of valence electrons in its outer shell. Calcium will lose two valence electrons to achieve the stable configuration of argon. Calcium is a reactive alkaline-earth metal found in group 2 of the periodic table.
This table and the accompanying observations were first presented to the Russian Chemical Society in March 1869. (Actually, Mendeleev was ill, and his colleague Nikolai Menshutkin presented his paper [Menschutkin 1934].) The paper was published in the first volume of the new society's journal.

By ordering the elements according to increasing atomic weight in vertical rows so that the horizontal rows contain analogous elements,[1] still ordered by increasing atomic weight, one obtains the following arrangement, from which a few general conclusions may be derived.
Atoms are composed of three type of particles: protons, neutrons, and electron. Protons and neutrons are responsible for most of the atomic mass e.g in a 150 person 149 lbs, 15 oz are protons and neutrons while only 1 oz. is electrons. The mass of an electron is very small (9.108 X 10-28 grams).
Both the protons and neutrons reside in the nucleus. Protons have a postive (+) charge, neutrons have no charge --they are neutral. Electrons reside in orbitals around the nucleus. They have a negative charge (-). It is the number of protons that determines the atomic number, e.g., H = 1.
Mendeleev's First Periodic Table. Dmitrii Mendeleev (1834-1907; see photo in Chemical Achievers at the Chemical Heritage Foundation) was born in Tobolsk, in Western Siberia. His chief contribution to chemistry was the establishment of the periodic system of elements. Mendeleev was one of a number of independent discoverers of the periodic law in the 1860s--that number ranging from one [Leicester 1948] to six [van Spronsen 1969] depending on the criteria one adopts.
1 The elements, if arranged according to their atomic weights, exhibit an evident stepwise variation[12] of properties.  Chemically analogous elements have either similar atomic weights[13] (Pt, Ir, Os), or weights which increase by equal increments (K, Rb, Cs).[14]
[03.01]The modern periodic table arrangement is a result of all of the following except. total rejection of the early versions for modern ideas. Question 2 (Multiple Choice Worth 1 points) [03.01]The modern periodic table reflects many improvements to Mendeleev's original table.
The scientist Dmitri Mendeleev, a Russian chemist, proposed an arrangement of know elements based on their atomic mass. The modern arrangement of the elements is known as the Periodic Table of Elements and is arranged according to the atomic number of elements.

Van Halen. The band went on to become major stars, and by the early 1980s they were one of the most successful rock acts of the time. 1984 was their most successful album. The lead single, Jump, became an international hit and their only single to reach number one on the Billboard Hot 100.
The 1986 Van Halen album 5150 was a huge hit, becoming the band's first No. 1 album on the Billboard charts, driven by the keyboard-dominated singles Why Can't This Be Love (#3 U.S.), Dreams, and Love Walks In (Top 30 U.S.). To further introduce the new era for the band, a new Van Halen logo was put on the cover.
Van Halen's 1978 debut album is a landmark of hard rock, with a patented and unique acid bubblegum and chrome-plated neon sound that is positively enthralling and thrilling.
Van Halen’s colossal hit “Jump” is the band’s only number one hit on the Billboard Hot 100. “Jump” knocked out Culture Club’s “Karma Chameleon” to hold the top spot on the Billboard Hot 100 for an impressive FIVE straight weeks!

One, the most common, is the easiest to recycle; ones are typically soda bottles and other plastic food containers and bottles. Twos--milk jugs, laundry detergent containers, shampoo bottles--are commonly recyclable as well. Threes through sevens are manufactured from types of plastic that are rarely recyclable.
Wash and reuse plastic utensils rather than throwing them away. Other reuses for plastic utensils include using them for craft projects, plant supports for new seedlings, toys (for kids playing restaurant), kids' lunchboxes (make sure they bring the home to wash and reuse) and cutting knives for clay.
Keep reading to find out whether plastic utensils and straws can be recycled in…. Burbank: Not curbside. Plastic utensils and drinking straws can be placed in the mixed plastics bin at the Burbank Recycle Center. Culver City: Utensils, yes.
Some curbside programs, like Fort Worth’s, will accept plastic utensils, but because plastic forks and knives are so small, some locations, like Easton, PA, will not. If neither your waste hauler nor your local recycling center accepts plastic utensils, you should throw them in the trash after the first use.
Plastic utensils are usually made of polyethylene terephthalate (plastic No. 1) or polystyrene (plastic No. 6). Drinking straws are usually made from polypropylene (plastic No. 5). Although plasticware and plastic drinking straws are rarely marked with recycling symbols, they are recyclable in L.A.’s blue bin.
Plastic utensils can be real time savers when it comes to cleanup--just throw them away. But if you're environmentally conscious and wonder if you can recycle those plastic spoons and forks, the answer is yes and no.
Dear Lanny: The operative word there is “clean.” As we’ve covered, food waste can taint a batch of recycling. It sounds like you’ve got that down, though. You’ll be happy to know that if you have chopsticks or plastic utensils hiding in your kitchen, they don’t necessarily have to end up in the trash.

Care must be taken to avoid confusing generic Macrobid with generic Macrodantin® (nitrofurantoin macrocrystalline), a similar medication that is taken four times a day. The generic names are quite similar and are often abbreviated in order to fit on prescription labels. While most pharmacists are aware of this potential problem and are careful to avoid confusing the two, it is a good idea to check with your pharmacist if your generic Macrobid looks different from the Macrobid pills you have received before.
Macrobid® (nitrofurantoin monohydrate/macrocrystals) Capsules. To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Macrobid and other antibacterial drugs, Macrobid should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by bacteria. DESCRIPTION
The Nitrofurantoin, which is the generic for Macrobid, is what I used while pregnant, and it cleared my UTI up everytime. Vomiting and nausea is a side effect of the macrobid, and in the future, I would tell my doctor that it caused you to be sick. They can try something else and hopefully it won't make you feel so bad.
Generic Macrobid At this time, generic Macrobid (nitrofurantoin monohydrate/macrocrystalline) is available in only one strength. It is made by a number of companies, including Mylan Pharmaceuticals and Sandoz. If you have been taking a generic version of this antibiotic and it looks a little different than normal, check with your pharmacist.
Learn about Macrobid (Nitrofurantoin) may treat, uses, dosage, side effects, drug interactions, warnings, patient labeling, reviews, and related medications.
To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Macrobid and other antibacterial drugs, Macrobid should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria.
Other Forms of Generic Nitrofurantoin Care must be taken to avoid confusing generic Macrobid with generic Macrodantin ® (nitrofurantoin macrocrystalline), a similar medication that is taken four times a day. The generic names are quite similar and are often abbreviated in order to fit on prescription labels.
Hi, Nitrofurantoin is the generic name of Macrobid and is used to treat urinary tract infections. It is not expected to be harmful to an unborn baby, unless it is used during the last 2 to 4 weeks of pregnancy. You can first take the antibiotics until the prescribed period then take the pregnancy test after.
6 weeks ago, I took a course of Macrobid (generic) for a UTI. After completing the 7 day cycle, I developed excruciating heartburn, to the point of tears. The following day (2 days after Macrobid) I started itching (scalp, chest, neck, arms...) This has gone on for 6 weeks! I have been to the doctors, ER, allergist to no avail.
I was put on a antibiotic called nitrofurantoin mono which is the generic for Macrobid capsules. This medicine is 100mg. I figured if I did have any kind of kidney infection this antibiotic would take care of it. Unfortunately upon reading about this drug it says it should not be used to treat kidney infections due to think low blood flow.
Miriam Schapiro is a leading figure in the feminist art movement. Often tied to the 1970s era Pattern and Decoration movement, Schapiro creating a path forward for herself and her colleagues as she worked to resurrect the reputations of women artists who had been forgotten or dismissed by art historians.
The Brooklyn-born feminist artist was known for her erotic artworks, unabashedly depicting the male nude form, which created a controversy in the 1970s. In response, Steckel started an all-female art collective known as the Fight Censorship Group. It included notables such as Louise Bourgeois and Hannah Wilke.
Rosie the Riveter is a cultural icon of the United States, representing the American women who worked in factories and shipyards during World War II, many of whom produced munitions and war supplies.

Anita Steckel — the artist who “always felt a tension between being a woman who liked men and being an artist who chafed at the limits that men had historically placed on women” — died several weeks ago, according to a new report from the New York Times.
In 1982, the We Can Do It! poster was reproduced in a magazine article, Poster Art for Patriotism's Sake, a Washington Post Magazine article about posters in the collection of the National Archives. In subsequent years, the poster was re-appropriated to promote feminism.
First Things First... This class will look at how feminist thinking has impacted the arts—both by looking at the work of women artists influenced by these ideas since the 1960s, and by considering how a feminist lens can change the way we look at art made throughout history, and even the category of art itself.
Judy Chicago. Judy Chicago is an American feminist artist and author. Originally associated with the Minimalist movement of the 1960s, Chicago soon abandoned this in favor of creating content-based art. Her most famous work to date is the installation piece The Dinner Party (1974-79), an homage to women's history.
The We Can Do It! image was used to promote feminism and other political issues beginning in the 1980s. The image made the cover of the Smithsonian magazine in 1994 and was fashioned into a US first-class mail stamp in 1999.
Feminist art: work that is rooted in the analyses and commitments of contemporary feminism and that contributes to a critique of the political, economic and ideological power relations of contemporary society. It is not a stylistic category nor simply any art produced by women.
The poster was seen very little during World War II. It was rediscovered in the early 1980s and widely reproduced in many forms, often called We Can Do It! but also called Rosie the Riveter after the iconic figure of a strong female war production worker.

- the dipole antenna or dipole aerial is a key element in the antenna environment. It can be used on its own or as part of another antenna system. Dipole tutorial includes. The dipole antenna or dipole aerial is one of the most important and commonly used types of RF antenna. The dipole aerial or antenna is widely used on its own, but it is also incorporated into many other RF antenna designs where it forms the radiating or driven element for the overall antenna.
Is COCl2 polar? An ion-dipole force is a type of intermolecular force in which forces of attraction or repulsion occur between neighboring ions, molecules or atoms. The ion-dipole force results from the attraction of an ion of negative or positive charge and the oppositely charged end of the dipole molecule.
Ion-dipole forces are inter-molecular forces that occur between an ion and a polar molecule. An ion is an atom or group of atoms that holds an electrical charge, while a dipole refers to a molecule that possesses a delocalized positive and negative charge. Ion-dipole forces, therefore, are the electrostatic interactions between the fixed dipole in one molecule and an ion.
The figures show two arrangements of polar iodine monochloride (ICl) molecules that give rise to dipole-dipole attractions. Note: 1  Polar molecules have a partial negative end and a partial positive end.  The partially positive end of a polar molecule is attracted to the partially negative end of another.
1 Being half a wavelength long it is a resonant antenna. 2  Multiple half waves dipole antenna: It is possible to utilise a dipole antenna or aerial that is an odd multiple of half wavelengths long.  Folded dipole antenna: As the name implies this form of the dipole aerial or dipole antenna is folded back on itself.
dipole - a pair of equal and opposite electric charges or magnetic poles separated by a small distance. couple - (physics) something joined by two equal and opposite forces that act along parallel lines. electric dipole, electric doublet - a dipole with equal and opposite electric charges.
1 In a ICl molecule the more electronegative chlorine atom bears the partial negative charge; the less electronegative iodine atom bears the partial positive charge.  The partially positive iodine end of one ICl molecule is attracted to the partially negative chlorine end of another ICl molecule.
Although the dipole antenna is often though in its half wave format, there are nevertheless many forms of the antenna that can be used. Half wave dipole antenna: The half wave dipole antenna is the one that is most widely used . Being half a wavelength long it is a resonant antenna.
1. a pair of electric charges or magnetic poles of equal magnitude and opposite sign, set a finite distance apart. 2. a polar molecule. 3. Also called di′pole anten′na. an antenna of a transmitter or receiving set consisting of two equal rods extending in opposite direction from the connection to the lead-in wire.
Also found in: Thesaurus, Medical, Encyclopedia, Wikipedia. Related to dipole: dipole moment, dipole molecule, dipole antenna, electric dipole, magnetic dipole. (dī′pōl′) n. 1. Physics A pair of separated electric charges or magnetic poles, of equal magnitude but of opposite sign or polarity. 2. Chemistry A molecule having two such charges or poles. 3. Electronics An antenna, usually fed from the center, consisting of two equal rods extending outward in a straight line.

12 Facts About Disney's The Jungle Book. It may not have followed Rudyard Kipling's book exactly—in fact, Walt Disney preferred that scriptwriters not read the book—but The Jungle Book was a toe-tapping box office success. Here are a few bare necessities you should know about the 1967 animated classic ahead of its live-action reboot slated for an April 15 wide release.
Disappointed by the muted reception to The Sword in the Stone (1963), Walt Disney was determined to come back with a universally well-regarded film. He told his animation crew to throw away. Rudyard Kipling's book The Jungle Book because the original concept storyboards were too dark and dramatic. During pre-production, Disney assigned animator Larry Clemmons to head story development on the project.
Boyhood Lessons Looped in Parental Love. by Scott Holleran. Walt Disney's The Jungle Book, an animated musical loosely based on Rudyard Kipling's stories, is a benevolent outing. The 1967 movie follows a child named Mowgli (Bruce Reitherman) from infancy through boyhood.
Tragic story behind Kipling's Jungle Book revealed as first edition is found 116 years after it was published. It became one of the most loved children's books in the English language, but 116 years later the tragic personal story behind Rudyard Kipling' classic The Jungle Book has been brought to light.
It is a very desirable book and lovely because it is a children's book inscribed by the author to his child.'. A signed first edition of The Jungle Book went for $12,000 at Sotherby's in New York in 2004. Born in Bombay, Rudyard Kipling was named after Rudyard Lake, Staffordshire, a beauty spot his parents visited.

With the novel's publication, Sinclair achieved one of his goals: The Jungle was wildly successful. He failed to get his point across, though. I aimed at the public's heart, Sinclair famously complained after the book was published, and by accident I hit it in the stomach..
Meanwhile, The Jungle depicts the meatpacking world in painstaking and lurid detail, so that it's small wonder that those sections made the strongest impression. Sinclair was a meticulous reporter and a vivid explainer, not just of the industry but of the interlocking worlds of factory and slum and political machine.

Endothelial dysfunction. In vascular diseases, endothelial dysfunction is a systemic pathological state of the endothelium (the inner lining of blood vessels) and can be broadly defined as an imbalance between vasodilating and vasoconstricting substances produced by (or acting on) the endothelium.
The Mechanics Behind Erectile Dysfunction. When blood fills two chambers in the penis (known as the corpora cavernosa) an erection occurs. This causes the penis to expand and stiffen, much like a balloon as it is filled with water. The process is triggered by nerve impulses from the brain and genital area.
Endothelial dysfunction can result from and/or contribute to several disease processes, as occurs in hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia, diabetes, septic shock, and Behcet's disease, and it can also result from environmental factors, such as from smoking tobacco products and exposure to air pollution.
Incidence of dysfunctions. Most current treadmill studies rate Pharyngeal dysfunctions i)* and ii) as the most common ahead of combinations of Laryngeal dysfunctions i) and ii). * This dysfunction is often observed but not often directly referred to as such! PHARYNGEAL FUNCTION.
LARYNGEAL DYSFUNCTION Dysfunctions of the larynx include:-. i) left or right laryngeal paresis or paralysis. ii) left and / or right dilation and prolapse of the lateral ventricles and associated vocal folds. iii) 4BAD-fourth branchial arch defects.

Erectile dysfunction (ED) is when a man has persistent problems achieving and/or sustaining an erection. Erectile dysfunction can make sexual intercourse impossible without treatment. Erectile dysfunction can first emerge in a man as early as 40 according to the Massachusetts Male Aging Study on sexual dysfunction.
Other forms of male sexual dysfunction include poor libido and problems with ejaculation. Men with erectile dysfunction often have a healthy libido, but their bodies fail to respond in the sexual encounter by producing an erection. Usually there is a physical basis for the problem.
According to LoLking (http://www.lolking.net/champions/), the current top 10 win-rate champions in order: 1  Amumu (14.29% popularity, 55.59% win rate) 2  Fiora (7.9% popularity, 54.55% win rate) 3  Rammus (4.65% popularity, 54.43% win rate)  Warwick (14.46% popularity, 54.31% win 1  rate) Rumble (1.43% popularity, 54.17% win rate)
Sort the champions in 'win rate', and the highest, you will find, are BOSS in solo queue. So many times I just win games because my team has champs in the top 10 win rates. I really can't stress how true I think this chart is. It updates every day - and really reflects the current 'meta' and changes to champions.
The thing with Bronze is that people generally don't respect pick order for one bit. More often then not I ended up with 2 ADC'ers or no junglers because people either wanted to go double top or didn't want to pick support. Because of that I decided to main support but I believe I can't carry as a support player.
These champions simply have a very strong kit which is orientated to work against a perhaps less organised team, where there are more 1v1 or 2v1 fights rather than full 5v5s. For example, Fiddlesticks is as of 7/24 the 3rd highest win rate champion in ranked solo queue. Despite that, he's never played in the lcs.

If I had to pick one champ to carry out of Bronze though, it would be Wukong. He does it all really, and if you can learn his laning phase, you can really take over games and lead your team to victory. What's really going to get you out of bronze though is just getting better.
According to LoLking (http://www.lolking.net/champions/), the current top 10 win-rate champions in order: Amumu (14.29% popularity, 55.59% win rate) Fiora (7.9% popularity, 54.55% win rate) Rammus (4.65% popularity, 54.43% win rate) Warwick (14.46% popularity, 54.31% win rate) Rumble (1.43% popularity, 54.17% win rate)
The only gripe I have with the comment is that Trundle is NOT a damage support. He literally only does damage when he's on top of the enemy and unlike Nautilus, Leona, etc. he can't close gaps on a whim.
Hi, I went over to lol statistics to look at which champions had the highest and lowest win rates in ranked. Top 15 highest win rates. 1) Janna 11) Nautilis. 2) Soraka 12) Fiddlesticks. 3) Amumu 13) Taric. 4) Warwick 14) Volibear. 5) Sona 15) Sion. 6) Mordekaiser.
Trundle Support Currently Has the Highest Win Rate in Plat+ Games... I don't get it. So, Trundle is the top dog support right now, according to that data. I understand that he is a tank slayer, but the skill progression of maxing E indicates that there's something potent about his pillar being on low cooldown.

Renewable Energy. There are many forms of renewable energy. Most of these renewable energies depend in one way or another on sunlight. Wind and hydroelectric power are the direct result of differential heating of the Earth's surface which leads to air moving about (wind) and precipitation forming as the air is lifted.ther renewable energies that do not depend on sunlight are geothermal energy, which is a result of radioactive decay in the crust combined with the original heat of accreting the Earth, and tidal energy, which is a conversion of gravitational energy. Solar.

Re: Corriander and Cilantro. From what i have seen .. corriander or cilantro is pretty much used interchangably as a name for the fresh leaves. latin or N. American recipes usually refer to the leaves as cilantro but Indian and asian recipes seem to prefer corriander for the fresh leaves.owever as also mentioned above, in other countries Cilantro tends to refer to leaf and corriander to seeds... Steve. I checked around and it looks like the seeds come from the same plant as the leaves. Cilantro is the term in N. America for the leaves, but at least you know what we're talking about.

Acute Kidney Injury. Acute kidney injury is a condition where your kidneys suddenly stop working properly. Usually this happens when you are unwell from another illness. If you have acute kidney injury you are often already ill in hospital. If not, you will usually be sent to hospital to be looked after.
What Happens When Dialysis Stops working. When dialysis stop working, deadly results may come to light. When kidney disease develop into end stage of kidney failure, dialysis will be life-sustaining treatment. About 1/4 of Kidney Failure patients choose to stop dialysis, however, most of them died within sever days to several weeks. When dialysis stops, the waste products and extra fluids will build up in the blood, causing various complications which may affect all system and organs of your body.
When someone’s kidneys stop working we call this kidney failure. Damage to the kidneys usually happens over time. When someone’s kidneys stop working that means that they need treatment to keep them alive. Treatments for kidney failure are called dialysis and transplant. Dialysis is a way of cleaning the blood outside the body through a machine. The dialysis machine cleans your body’s blood when your kidneys stop working well.
You may feel that dialysis is no longer maintaining or improving your quality of life. If this occurs, it is important to know that you have the right to make the decision to stop dialysis. However, before making this decision, it is important that you discuss it carefully with your loved ones and treatment team.
Your kidneys are bean-shaped organs, each about the size of your fist. They are located near the middle of your back, just below the rib cage. The kidneys are sophisticated trash collectors. Every day, your kidneys process about 200 quarts of blood to sift out about 2 quarts of waste products and extra water.
If you decide to stop dialysis treatment, you or your surrogate may want to make sure the following items are in order: 1  Your will. 2  Signed advance directive (living will, durable health care power of attorney or health care proxy) complying with your state law.
Complete and irreversible kidney failure is sometimes called end-stage renal disease, or ESRD. If your kidneys stop working completely, your body fills with extra water and waste products. This condition is called uremia. Your hands or feet may swell. You will feel tired and weak because your body needs clean blood to function properly.
Kidney Problems. Causes & Symptoms. Age-related changes in your kidneys, while not usually enough to cause illness, may become harmful in the presence of specific diseases or situations. When this happens, the healthy balance of fluids, electrolytes, and acids and bases in your body may become compromised.
If you choose to stop dialysis, you are considered to be in a terminal state and you are eligible for hospice care. The type of hospice care available may be either a home hospice program or a hospice facility. Your social worker can help you and your loved ones in making arrangements for hospice care.
If the kidney's fail, then the kidneys no longer filter impurities out of the blood. This is extremely painful and requires dialysis; artificial filtration of the blood. If dialysis is not administered renal failure results in death. 30 people found this useful.
Formation [edit]. Neurofibrillary tangles are formed by hyperphosphorylation of a microtubule-associated protein known as tau, causing it to aggregate, or group, in an insoluble form.(These aggregations of hyperphosphorylated tau protein are also referred to as PHF, or  paired helical filaments ).t was found that only an increase in neurofibrillary tangle load was associated with severity of aggression and chronic aggression in Alzheimer's patients. While this study does indicate a correlation between NFT load and severity of aggression, it does not provide a causative argument.

Neurofibrillary tangles are insoluble twisted fibers found inside the brain's cells. These tangles consist primarily of a protein called tau, which forms part of a structure called a microtubule. The microtubule helps transport nutrients and other important substances from one part of the nerve cell to another.ne of the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease is the accumulation of amyloid plaques between nerve cells (neurons) in the brain. Amyloid is a general term for protein fragments that the body produces normally.

Tauopathies are a class of neurodegenerative diseases associated with the pathological aggregation of tau protein in the human brain. The best-known of these illnesses is Alzheimer's disease (AD), wherein tau protein is deposited within neurons in the form of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs).They were first described by the eponymous Alois Alzheimer in one of his patients suffering from the disorder.These aggregations of hyperphosphorylated tau protein are also referred to as PHF, or  paired helical filaments ). The precise mechanism of tangle formation is not completely understood, and it is still controversial as to whether tangles are a primary causative factor in the disease or play a more peripheral role.
As one of the hallmarks of ALZHEIMER DISEASE, the neurofibrillary tangles eventually occupy the whole of the cytoplasm in certain classes of cell in the neocortex, hippocampus, brain stem, and diencephalon.hese double helical stacks of transverse subunits are twisted into left-handed ribbon-like filaments that likely incorporate the following proteins: (1) the intermediate filaments: medium-and high-molecular-weight neurofilaments; (2) the microtubule-associated proteins map-2 and tau; (3) actin; and (4) UBIQUITINS.

Share. As children, we're taught that zoos save endangered species and educate the public about animals, but zoos are not that simple and the arguments for and against zoos concern the treatment of the animals as well as the real lessons that children learn.
The use of animals to entertain human beings is wrong from the welfare point of view because: 1  it removes animals from their natural habitat and social structure. 2  it involves the animal in performances that are foreign to their natural behaviour.
The use of animals to entertain human beings is wrong because: 1  it treats the animal as a means to achieve some human end. 2  it fails to treat animals with the respect they deserve. 3  it violates the animal's right to live in freedom.

Globally, thousands of wild animals are still forced to perform demeaning and unnatural tricks to entertain the public. They are exploited in travelling circuses, side-shows and within zoos, and used in advertising, film and television.
Testing on animals is a trail that drugs undergo before they are tested on humans; by testing drugs on animals we are able to see how the drug will effect a living organism before we go and test it on humans. Through this method we are able to find and fix all the errors with the drugs before they are tested on humans.
Animals in Entertainment refers to any animal(s) used to act, perform, fight and/or kill for the enjoyment of humans. The term encompasses many different forms of entertainment – from circuses to movies to bullfighting.
Sanders could pass for 75 to 83, Hillary looks older than Trump, even though she's younger than he is. Trump isn't easy on the eyes, but he just doesn't seem that feeble, and his hair isn't grey.
Here’s one more photo of young Donald Trump with a couple of family members. He’s on the far left. This photo of young Donald Trump comes right out of his high school yearbook. In case you didn’t know, he attended the New York Military Academy. By the age of 32, Donald was already looking like the Trump we know today. In the photo above, he is holding his first born son, Donald Jr. This picture was taken almost 40 years ago. Apparently, this is one of Trump’s favorite photos with his father.
Donald is on the far left. By age 32, Trump was well on the way to looking like the Trump we know now. Here he is, holding his first son, Donald Jr. Here's what he looked like some years later, just as he was about to turn 50 (he's now 69). Here he is with the late president Reagan, probably sometime in the 80s. And here's a photo of young Trump that's particular dear to him, one with his father.
He is 28 years younger than Sander, 24 years younger than Trump and Clinton. Yet, to me, he has no appearance of innovation or new ideas. He has the view of what America is or shoud be as someone from the McCarthy era or an original member of the John Birch Society.
Donald Trump’s Throwback Photo With Young Ivanka Creeps Out Twitter Users. Donald and Ivanka attend the The Trump Card: Playing to Win in Work and Life book launch celebration at Trump Tower in New York City, Oct. 14, 2009. A picture of Donald Trump and his daughter Ivanka, when she was 15 years old, is making people cringe and speculate if she is indeed his biological daughter.
First, he's fairly energetic for his age, and even if some of it is chemically enhanced (tans, hair dye) he doesn't particularly look like he's 69. Just to add a data point, my dad is 70, and even though he eats well and takes karate lessons (2nd degree black belt -- go Dad!), his hair has gone totally white and he looks older than Mr. Trump.
Donald has been said to be inappropriate in his comments about his daughter and in 2003, he said on a radio show with Howard Stern: “You know who’s one of the great beauties of the world, according to everybody. And I helped create her. Ivanka. My daughter, Ivanka.
When Fred Trump visited one of his contractors, he sometimes brought Donald along and hired a teenage boy who lived next door to watch him during the meeting. One afternoon, recalled the sitter, Frank Briggs, 81, he led Trump on a sewer ad­ven­ture during which “it was pitch black and you couldn’t see the entrance.”.
Donald spent enough time in detention, Onish said, that his buddies nicknamed the punishment “DTs” — short for “Donny Trump.”. “He had a reputation for saying anything that came into his head,” said Donald Kass, 70, a retired agronomist who was a schoolmate. When Trump misidentified Rocca, the pro wrestler, Kass recalled, “We would laugh at him and tell him he was wrong, and he’d say he was right.
For a while now I've looked at Trump and thought, Hmmm, he reminds me of someone, but was unable to pinpoint it. Then today my brain just clicked and I yelled, OMG DONALD TRUMP AND OWEN WILSON LOOK ALIKE..

Causes of vertigo. Vertigo is a symptom of several different conditions. There are two types of vertigo, known as peripheral and central, depending on the cause. Peripheral vertigo is the most common type, often caused by a problem with the balance mechanisms of the inner ear. 1  The most common causes include: 2  benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) 3  head injury. 4  labyrinthitis. 5  vestibular neuronitis. 6  Ménière's disease. 7  taking certain types of medication.
Central vertigo is caused by problems in part of your brain, such as the cerebellum (located at the bottom of the brain) or the brainstem (the lower part of the brain that's connected to the spinal cord). 1  Causes of central vertigo include: 1  migraines – a severe headache that's usually felt as a throbbing pain at the front or on one side of your head, which is especially common in younger people. 2  multiple sclerosis – a condition that affects the central nervous system (the brain and spinal cord)
Meniere’s Disease can be accompanies by fluctuating hearing loss, ringing in the ear and a feeling of fullness in the affected ear. Acoustic neuroma — a non-cancerous growth on the vestibular nerve — which connects the inner ear to your brain can also cause vertigo.
Severe vertigo is sometimes caused by a rare condition that affects the inner ear, called Ménière's disease. This can cause vertigo, as well as hearing loss, tinnitus and aural fullness (a feeling of pressure in your ear).
“Vertigo usually results from a sudden or temporary change in the activity of the balance sensors in the inner ear or in the balance sensors’ connections to the brain, both of which detect movement and changes in your head position,” Lotkowski said.
What causes vertigo. Inner ear problems, which affect balance, are the most common causes: benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) – where specific head movements cause vertigo; labyrinthitis – an inner ear infection caused by a cold or flu virus; vestibular neuronitis – inflammation of the vestibular nerve
Disequilibrium, the loss of balance or feeling unsteady when you walk, is also a condition many people refer to as being dizzy. Sensory disorders such as failing vision or nerve damage, joint and muscle problems like weakness and osteoarthritis, neurological conditions including Parkinson’s Disease or cerebellar ataxia and medical side effects can also cause a loss of balance sometimes referred to as dizziness.
“The way dizziness makes you feel, such as the sensation of the room spinning, feeling faint or as if you’ve lost your balance, provides clues for possible causes,” she said. Lotkowski said approximately 10 percent of her patients come in complaining about dizziness.
Ménière's disease – a rare inner ear condition, which sometimes involves ringing in the ear (tinnitus) or loss of hearing; Other things that can cause vertigo: migraine; some types of medicine – check the leaflet to see if it's listed as a side effect; Sometimes the cause is unknown.
Treatment for vertigo. Most cases of vertigo get better without treatment. Treatment will depend on the cause. Your GP might prescribe antibiotics if it's caused by an infection. You could also be given special exercises to do to try and correct your balance. Antihistamines can sometimes help with vertigo symptoms.

Effects of a Spinal Cord Injury. The effects on the respiratory system from a spinal cord injury will vary from person to person, however, several generalisations can be made with regards to the level of injury and how it affects the breathing process.he respiratory system of a person suffering a spinal cord injury may be impaired due to paralysis of the chest muscles, abdominal muscles or diaphragm.

As with all trauma patients, initial clinical evaluation of a patient with suspected spinal cord injury (SCI) begins with a primary survey. The primary survey focuses on life-threatening conditions.Assessment of airway, breathing, and circulation (ABCs) takes precedence. careful neurologic assessment, including motor function, sensory evaluation, deep tendon reflexes, and perineal evaluation, is critical and required to establish the presence or absence of spinal cord injury and to classify the lesion according to a specific cord syndrome.
Pulmonary evaluation. The clinical assessment of pulmonary function in acute spinal cord injury begins with careful history taking regarding respiratory symptoms and a review of underlying cardiopulmonary comorbidity such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or heart failure. careful neurologic assessment, including motor function, sensory evaluation, deep tendon reflexes, and perineal evaluation, is critical and required to establish the presence or absence of spinal cord injury and to classify the lesion according to a specific cord syndrome.
Spinal cord injuries (SCIs) often lead to impairment of the respiratory system and, consequently, restrictive respiratory changes. Paresis or paralysis of the respiratory muscles can lead to respiratory insufficiency, which is dependent on the level and completeness of the injury.Respiratory complications include hypoventilation, a reduction in surfactant production, mucus plugging, atelectasis, and pneumonia.aresis or paralysis of the respiratory muscles can lead to respiratory insufficiency, which is dependent on the level and completeness of the injury. Respiratory complications include hypoventilation, a reduction in surfactant production, mucus plugging, atelectasis, and pneumonia.
The degree of respiratory dysfunction is ultimately dependent on preexisting pulmonary comorbidity, the level of the spinal cord injury, and any associated chest wall or lung injury. careful neurologic assessment, including motor function, sensory evaluation, deep tendon reflexes, and perineal evaluation, is critical and required to establish the presence or absence of spinal cord injury and to classify the lesion according to a specific cord syndrome.

Corgard is effective at treating symptoms of angina because it decreases the workload of the heart. This, in turn, means that the heart needs less oxygen and nutrient-rich blood to function properly at any given level of effort. Corgard does not cure this type of heart disease. When your blood pressure is measured, the results are given as a combination of two numbers (for example, 120/80, said as 120 over 80). The top number is known as the systolic blood pressure, and the bottom number is the diastolic blood pressure.
This medication treats, but does not cure, high blood pressure. It is important to continue taking this medication even if you feel well. Most people with high blood pressure do not feel sick. Do not stop taking this medication without consulting your doctor.
Nadolol is used alone or with other medications to treat high blood pressure (hypertension) and to prevent chest pain (angina). Lowering high blood pressure helps prevent strokes, heart attacks, and kidney problems.

Use this drug for a condition that is listed in this section only if it has been so prescribed by your health care professional.
Using Corgard for Angina. Angina is a type of heart disease that occurs when the heart muscle is not getting enough nutrient-rich and oxygen-rich blood for a short period of time. The inadequate blood flow is caused by narrowed coronary arteries (the blood vessels that supply blood to the heart).
A very serious allergic reaction to this drug is unlikely, but seek immediate medical attention if it occurs. Symptoms of a serious allergic reaction may include: rash, itching/swelling (especially of the face/tongue/throat), severe dizziness, trouble breathing.
Nadolol belongs to a class of medications called beta blockers. It works by blocking the action of certain natural substances such as adrenaline (epinephrine) on the heart and blood vessels. This results in a lowering of heart rate, blood pressure, and strain on the heart.
Contraindications[edit] Nadolol and other beta blockers should be used with cautions in people with heart failure and its use should not be abruptly stopped. It is contraindicated for people with asthma, a slow heart rate and certain severe heart problems.
Corgard Uses. Corgard is a medication that is used for treating angina and high blood pressure in adults. It is a type of beta blocker that lowers blood pressure and decreases the workload of the heart by blocking beta receptors in the body.
Nadolol (Corgard) is a non-selective beta blocker used in the treatment of high blood pressure and chest pain. Additionally, it is often prescribed in the treatment of atrial fibrillation, migraine headaches, and complications of cirrhosis. 1 Medical uses.
The number of Native Americans living on reservations and trust lands vary substantially. According to the 2000 census, only ten reservations had a resident population of more than 7,000. These were the Navajo, Fort Apache, Gila River, Papago, Rosebud, San Carlos, Zuni Pueblo, Hopi, and Blackfeet reservations.
In the United States, Native Americans (also known as American Indians, Amerindians, Indigenous Americans or simply Indians; see §Terminology differences) are people descended from the Pre-Columbian indigenous population of the land within the country's modern boundaries.
In 1817, the Cherokee became the first Native Americans recognized as U.S. citizens. Under Article 8 of the 1817 Cherokee treaty, Upwards of 300 Cherokees (Heads of Families) in the honest simplicity of their souls, made an election to become American citizens.
“If I knew contracts would be enforced, then I could do a lot more business there.”. At a time when there’s a spotlight on America’s richest 1%, a look at the country’s 310 Indian reservations–where many of America’s poorest 1% live–can be more enlightening.
I think the thing that plagues many Native American populations is poverty, misunderstanding of native culture, and continued biased towards Natives, especially in communities that surround native reserves. Also the access to education beyond what most reservations offer is difficult to access, I know this first hand.
According to the 2000 census, there are 2,475,956 Native Americans in the United States, but only a portion of those individuals are citizens in one of the 510 federally recognized Native American tribes. Of that number, 437,079 American Indians, 182 Eskimos, and 97 Aleuts resided on 314 reservations and trust lands. About 50 percent of the 437,358 American Indians, Eskimos, and Aleuts reside on the ten largest reservations and trust lands.
Indian Country Demographics. POPULATION. About 32 percent of Natives are under the age of 18, compared to only 24% of the total population who are under the age of 18. The median age for American Indians and Alaska Natives on reservations is 26, compared to 37 for the entire nation.
In 1871, Congress added a rider to the Indian Appropriations Act, signed into law by President Ulysses S. Grant, ending United States recognition of additional Native American tribes or independent nations, and prohibiting additional treaties.
That is very difficult question to answer. Every tribe is different and interprets who is considered Native American and who isn't. Then you have the wannabe tribes, who in an attempt to make money say they are native, when in fact they are not. As far as degrees go, that also is a very difficult question to answer. It would depend on how statics are taken, how many real native identify as native and how many non natives identify as native.
Total AI/AN population alone or in combination with other races: 5.2 million or 1.7 percent of the US population.(r2) About 32 percent of Natives are under the age of 18, compared to only 24% of the total population who are under the age of 18. The median age for American Indians and Alaska Natives on reservations is 26, compared to 37 for the entire nation.

The maximum number of contacts you can add to a personal distribution list within the Microsoft Outlook Address Book is roughly 60 to 120. There is no specific maximum number of contacts because the actual limit is measured in kilobytes, not number of contacts. Exchange has an 8 KB limit on the contacts it can process. So if your contacts only consist of very short email addresses and names, you might be able to create distribution lists with more than 120 addresses.

HPV/Genital Warts. HPV vaccines protect against a very common sexually transmitted virus called HPV or human papillomavirus. HPV infects at least 50% of sexually active people at some point in their lives. The virus often clears from the body on its own.
HPV vaccine is an inactivated (not live) vaccine which protects against four major types of HPV. These include two types that cause about 70% of cervical cancer and two types that cause about 90% of genital warts. HPV vaccine can prevent most genital warts and most cases of cervical cancer.
One HPV vaccine, Gardasil, was licensed for use by the FDA in 2006. It is recommended as a routine vaccination for males and females aged 9-26 years old. Gardasil 9 can be used in the same age group for females and for males ages 9 through 15.
The HPV strains that Gardasil protects against are sexually transmitted. The vaccine was approved in the US on June 8, 2006 by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In 2008, Gardasil was approved in 41 of U.S. states. The Gardasil vaccine has also been approved in 120 other countries.
There are two different HPV vaccines (Gardasil® and Cervarix®). Both have been licensed to treat conditions caused by certain types of human papillomavirus (HPV for short). Specifically, Gardasil is approved to protect against the following conditions in women and girls between the ages of 9 and 26: Cervical cancer.
HPV vaccine does not appear to cause any serious side effects. However, a vaccine, like any medicine, could possibly cause serious problems, such as severe allergic reactions. The risk of any vaccine causing serious harm, or death, is extremely small.
HPV vaccine is routinely recommended for girls 11 and 12 years of age. Doctors may give it to girls as young as 9 years. The HPV4 vaccine (the type recommended for prevention of genital warts in girls) may also be given in three doses to boys aged 9 to 26.
Gardasil and Cervarix (HPV vaccines) are used to help prevent infections from specific types of human papillomavirus (HPV).
Gardasil®, produced by Merck, prevents infection of four strains of HPV – 6, 11, 16, and 18 – and was approved by the FDA in 2006.22 Gardasil has been approved by the FDA for use in males and females ages 9-26.
See also: HPV vaccine. Gardasil. Gardasil, also known as Gardisil or Silgard or recombinant human papillomavirus vaccine [types 6, 11, 16, 18], is a vaccine for use in the prevention of certain strains of human papillomavirus (HPV), specifically HPV types 6, 11, 16 and 18.

BOSNIA. before the genocide. Rwanda has been called 'a tropical Switzerland in the heart of Africa'. It's about a third the size of Belgium, who administered it from 1919 under a League of Nations mandate (by which it ceased to be part of German East Africa) until independence in 1962.
During 2015 Rwanda population is estimated to be increased by 347 452 people and reach 12 792 002 in the beginning of 2016. The natural increase is expected to be positive, as the number of births will exceed the number of deaths by 334 261.
Languages. Kinyarwanda only (official, universal Bantu vernacular) 93.2%, Kinyarwanda and other language(s) 6.2%, French (official) and other language(s) 0.1%, English (official) and other language(s) 0.1%, Swahili (or Kiswahili, used in commercial centers) 0.02%, other 0.03%, unspecified 0.3% (2002 est.).
Most of the Rwandan population belong to the Hutu ethnic group, traditionally crop-growers. For many centuries Rwanda attracted Tutsis-traditionally herdsmen-from northern Africa. For 600 years the two groups shared the business of farming, essential for survival, between them. They have also shared their language, their culture, and their nationality. There have been many intermarriages.
The Kingdom of Rwanda dominated from the mid-eighteenth century, with the Tutsi kings conquering others militarily, centralising power, and later enacting anti-Hutu policies. Germany colonised Rwanda in 1884 as part of German East Africa, followed by Belgium, which invaded in 1916 during World War I. Both European nations ruled through the kings and perpetuated a pro-Tutsi policy. The Hutu population revolted in 1959.
Rwanda is a country of few natural resources, and the economy is based mostly on subsistence agriculture by local farmers using simple tools. An estimated 90% of the working population farms, and agriculture constituted an estimated 32.5% of GDP in 2014.
Population of Rwanda 2014. As of 1 January 2015, the population of Rwanda was estimated to be 12 444 550 people. This is an increase of 2.79 % (338 014 people) compared to population of 12 106 536 the year before. In 2014 the natural increase was positive, as the number of births exceeded the number of deaths by 325 182.
The Rwandan population is drawn from just one cultural and linguistic group, the Banyarwanda, although within this group there are three subgroups: the Hutu, Tutsi and Twa. The Twa are a forest-dwelling pygmy people descended from Rwanda's earliest inhabitants.
According to our estimations, daily change rates of Rwanda population in 2015 will be the following: 1  1 253 live births average per day (52.19 in a hour). 2  337 deaths average per day (14.04 in a hour). 3  36 immigrants average per day (1.51 in a hour).

Location: NW Arkansas. Posts: 12. Alternatives to Toyota pink super long life coolant. My girlfriend's '07 Yaris is piling on the miles, and I was researching alternatives to the OEM pink Super Long Life coolant/antifreeze that seems to only be sold pre-mixed in 50/50 concentration.hile most anti-freeze is similar at the basic level, the corrosion inhibitors used can be very different. I found that a Japanese company called CCI engineered and apparently contract-produces the correct type of coolant for late-model Toyotas, and it has been adopted by several other manufacturers.
Car Coolant. Your car coolant is crucial to your car's cooling system. The coolant contains glycol and water and is what prevents the engine from overheating.

It uses the spontaneous high torque from the electric motor from rest for starting.
$28 is a pretty high price, last time I bought SLLC coolant it was in the low $20's and LLC was priced about the same. Since you already bought and opened it, you can use it but note that the service life of LLC is only 30K miles (vs.50K miles for SLLC.) And you are right that LLC is concentrated, you should mix with distilled water to achieve 50% / 50% ratio.OP opened the coolant so its not likely it will be accepted for return.ince you already bought and opened it, you can use it but note that the service life of LLC is only 30K miles (vs. 50K miles for SLLC.)

Beta-carotene is one of a group of red, orange, and yellow pigments called carotenoids. Beta-carotene and other carotenoids provide approximately 50% of the vitamin A needed in the American diet. Beta-carotene can be found in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.It can also be made in a laboratory.aking beta-carotene, selenium, vitamin C, and vitamin E together might decrease the effectiveness of some medications used for lowering cholesterol. It is not known if beta-carotene alone decreases the effectiveness of some medications used for lowering cholesterol.

How to Plant a Tomato. When asking about how to plant tomatoes, the first question is how deep. Tomatoes have the ability to grow roots along their stems, so when planting tomato plants, plant deep; right up to the first set of leaves. This takes care of those leggy tomato seedlings.If the plant is too long and wobbly, dig a small trench and lay the plant on its side, gently bending it into a right angle.Bury the stem in this position leaving those first two leaves exposed.his takes care of those leggy tomato seedlings. If the plant is too long and wobbly, dig a small trench and lay the plant on its side, gently bending it into a right angle. Bury the stem in this position leaving those first two leaves exposed.
If one gets behind in planting or can only find leggy tomato plants here's something that one can do and get great results with them. Plants them on their side.This can be done with non-leggy plants as well. It can set the plant back some to do this but in the end you'll produce more roots for the plant (see below).The increase in roots will have several benefits such as more nutrient uptake and better drought resistance.his can be done with non-leggy plants as well.

Planting a tomato on its side is a technique that you can use to stimulate further root development and to induce a strengthening of the main trunk and the branching parts of the tomato, and therefore create a stronger plant for supporting the fruit development.lanting a tomato plant sideways tends to stimulate root development and strengthen the plant, and now you can learn how to bend a growing tomato plant toward the ground to encourage this growth pattern.
The best way to go about planting a tomato on its side would be to first plant it in the ground and to allow the plant to start to grow. It's important to allow the plant to stabilize in the ground upon initial transplanting and let the plant grow to be about two feet long.lanting a tomato plant sideways tends to stimulate root development and strengthen the plant, and now you can learn how to bend a growing tomato plant toward the ground to encourage this growth pattern.
He claims that 'we' don't plant enough of our tomatoe plants in the ground. You can plant up to 1/2 of the plant into the ground to encourage better root growth. The same can be accomplished by planting the plant on its side and leaving the top 1/3 above the ground. have a small grow box and. I have a small grow box and the manufacturer said to plant only 2 tomato plants in the box. I did that and at first they were growing like crazy but then one of the plants leaves started curling and drying out on the edges of the leaves.
Before you put your tomato plants in the soil, put one cup of kelp meal and one cup of bone meal into each planting hole to give them a turbocharged start. Kelp is an excellent all-around plant nutrient, which is rich in micronutrients, while bone meal is rich in phosphorus, which promotes flowers and fruits.ig a horizontal trench as long as the roots and stem together. Remove all the leaves from the plant with the exception of the top leaf cluster. Lay the plant on its side in the trench and cover the root system and bare stem up to the top leaf cluster with two to three inches of soil mixed with kelp and bone meal.
Like all tomatoes, heirloom varieties can produce roots along any portion of the stem that is buried. Planting the stems sideways in the soil increases the amount of roots and can lead to healthier plants.Planting heirloom tomatoes sideways also helps cure lanky growth caused by insufficient sunlight during the seedling period.ike all tomatoes, heirloom varieties can produce roots along any portion of the stem that is buried.

A transgenic plant is one that contains a gene or genes which have been introduced artificially into the plant's genetic makeup using a set of several biotechnology techniques collectively known as recombinant DNA (rDNA) technology.esearch using transgenic plants is an extremely valuable and powerful tool to help scientists learn about how plants function. The knowledge gained from this kind of research can be applied in many areas of plant science, not just in the creation of new crop varieties with novel traits.
Transgenic animals are animals (most commonly mice) that have had a foreign gene deliberately inserted into their genome.Such animals are most commonly created by the micro-injection of DNA into the pronuclei of a fertilised egg which is subsequently implanted into the oviduct of a pseudopregnant surrogate mother. transgenic animal is one whose genome has been altered by the transfer of a gene or genes from another species or breed. Transgenic animals are routinely used in the laboratory as models in biomedical research.
This process is also known as “genetic engineering.” Genes of one species can be modified, or genes can be transplanted from one species to another. Genetic engineering is made possible by recombinant DNA technology. Organisms that have altered genomes are known as transgenic.Most transgenic organisms are generated in the laboratory for research purposes.

Transgenic plants have been engineered for scientific research, to create new colours in plants, and to create different crops. In research, plants are engineered to help discover the functions of certain genes. One way to do this is to knock out the gene of interest and see what phenotype develops.loFish, the first genetically modified animal to be sold as a pet.

Whole Number Over One. One way to convert a whole number to a fraction is simply to make the whole number the numerator and make the denominator 1. If your whole number is 30, your fraction would be 30/1.The fraction is equal to 30, so you have not changed the number at all; you are just representing it in a different way.You can change any whole number into a fraction this way, but you always need to leave 1 as the denominator.f your whole number is 30, your fraction would be 30/1. The fraction is equal to 30, so you have not changed the number at all; you are just representing it in a different way. You can change any whole number into a fraction this way, but you always need to leave 1 as the denominator.
To convert the fraction to a whole number, simply divide the bottom number or denominator into the top number or numerator. Continue the long division beyond the decimal point if necessary until no remainder exists.. Thus 3/4 = 0.75. . and. .o convert the fraction to a whole number, simply divide the bottom number or denominator into the top number or numerator. Continue the long division beyond the decimal point if necessary until no remainder exists. . Thus 3/4 = 0.75.
First, make the whole number into a fraction. Make the number the denominator; the numerator is always 1. So now it looks like this: 3/ … 4 + 1/8 Now convert the fractions so the denominators are the same. 4 goes into 8 2 times so we multiply the numerator by 2 as well.s a general rule, proper fractions cannot turn into whole numbers and only in limited cases are improper fractions able to. To turn an improper fraction into a mixed number, … divide the denominator into the numerator. The result is the whole number. Put the remainder over the original denominator.
This is also called being top-heavy.. An improper fraction is most often turned into a mixed number with a remainder, but some fractions can be turned into whole numbers. A mixed number consists of a whole number and a fraction; for instance, 1 1/3 is a mixed number.In this case, the fraction 1/3 is classified as the remainder.. On the other hand, a whole number is a number like 2, 3, and 4.his is also called being top-heavy.. An improper fraction is most often turned into a mixed number with a remainder, but some fractions can be turned into whole numbers. A mixed number consists of a whole number and a fraction; for instance, 1 1/3 is a mixed number.
The denominator is the denominator of the fraction in the given mixed number. So 1 2/3 = 5/3. to bring 5/3 back to mixed number form, divide the numerator by the denominator. The whole number part is the quotient, the fraction part is the remainder / divisor. ok? oh! and make sure you express things in lowest terms.ating Newest Oldest.

The only other two CIA locations in the country are known to the public are the agency's headquarters in Langley, Virginia, and Camp Peary, a military base near Williamsburg, Virginia, known by its code name, “The Farm,” that is believed to be used for training, according to the Times.
Armed force is the use of armed forces to achieve political objectives. The profession of soldiering as part of a military is older than recorded history itself. Some of the most enduring images of the classical antiquity portray the power and feats of its military leaders.
“We’re not going to go out there as Officer Friendly with no body armor and just a handgun and say ‘Good enough.’ Congress created the military-transfer program in the early 1990s, when violent crime plagued America’s cities and the police felt outgunned by drug gangs.
SAN ANTONIO — Camp Stanley, a low-profile military weapons storage facility in northwest Bexar County, is home to one of the CIA's most mysterious weapons and explosives stockpiles, according to documents recently released by a retired CIA official who lives in San Antonio.
“The mission of Camp Stanley is the receipt, storage and issuance of ordnance material as well as quality assurance testing and maintenance of military weapons and ammunition,” Phil Reidinger, a spokesman for the Army Medical Department Center and School, said Monday.

- Deciduous, ideal for fresh eating, bears large, light blue berries with abundant white flowers. 4) Latham Red Raspberry (Rubus Idaeus 'Latham'). - This type of raspberry is disease-resistant and productive, deciduous, flavorful, aromatic, good texture, berries ripen in late June.
Goji berries are easy to grow in your garden. Native to Asia, goji berry plants (Lycium barbarum, or closely related Lycium chinense) are known by several common names, including matrimony vine and Chinese wolfberry. The open-pollinated seeds are easily spread by birds, and the mature shrubs also multiply by suckering.
One of the most hunted animals in the country, white-tailed deer will eat almost any plant including saplings, shrubs, grass, fruits, nuts and leaves. Because of their size and makeup, deer feed on plants close to the ground, making blueberry bushes an ideal food.
1 Provide large containers, and repot as the plants grow. 2  Plant goji as a hedge and leave the graceful, drooping branches untrimmed, or clip the branches to create thick bushes. 3  Space goji plants at least 2 feet apart to avoid overcrowding.
1 Although browsing deer relish goji twigs, leaves and berries, plants are not bothered by insects or serious diseases. 2  Powdery mildew may appear in foggy or coastal climate areas. 3  Treat mildew with fungicide. 4  Organic gardeners may choose a potassium-bicarbonate-based fungicide product.
These include cardiovascular disorders, advancing age-induced oxidative stress, inflammatory responses, and diverse degenerative diseases.. New deer resistant plants in my garden: Dusty Miller (Centaurea Cineraria). - Fuzzy, silver-gray leaves, bushy, compact habit, mounding annual, adds color contrast to beds.
Deer will eat blueberries, among many other plants. Deer are graceful animals and enjoyable to watch as they graze through forest and pasture lands. As beautiful as they are, they are invasive mammals with few predators, often causing overpopulation.
While deer tend to eat only the fruit of blueberry bushes, they will eat young plants if particularly hungry and cause damage to mature plants due to their bulk and rubbing against branches. Deer will feed on nearly every variety of blueberry, but there is one fruit, similar to blueberries, that they rarely eat.
Berries & Deer Resistant Plants. I bought 4 new berries for my garden: 1) Brazos Blackberry (Rubus Ursinus 'Brazos'). - Flowers early spring, easily planted in hedgerows, large clusters of edible fruit that ripens in late spring. 2) Bluecrop Blueberry (Vaccinium Corymbosum 'Bluecrop'. - Dceiduous, very productive, dependable shrub with large, firm bright blue berries.
Deer-Resistant Alternative. Deer will feed on nearly every variety of blueberry, but there is one fruit, similar to blueberries, that they rarely eat. The blueberry elder, or Sambucus Canadensis, is a wild plant that can also be purchased from greenhouses and online nurseries.

Other presidents have forgone salaries, too: President John F. Kennedy (1961 to 1963) had the largest family wealth in presidential history and gave the entirety of his salary to charity, for example, while President Herbert Hoover (1929 to 1933) dispersed his salary among charities and additional income for his team.
Vice President Joe Biden is not planning on donating a portion of his salary, eschewing the lead of President Obama and other Cabinet members who are giving up part of their salary as some federal workers face furloughs because of the sequester.
President's salary: Here's what presidents get paid and which presidents have gone without. The official presidential salary is $400,000 (plus $50,000 for expenses) — money that President-elect Donald Trump has said he will forgo. Trump reiterated the message he delivered on the campaign trail — that he would not accept a presidential salary — during an interview with Lesley Stahl for 60 Minutes, which aired Sunday night.
I'll take $1 a year, he vowed. Donald Trump said Sunday that he wasn't even sure what the presidential salary was -- but he wasn't taking it. During his first television interview as president-elect, Donald Trump told CBS News’ Leslie Stahl Sunday night that he would forgo taking a salary while he’s president. He added that he did not even know how much the president earned. “I think I have to by law take $1, so I’ll take $1 a year,” Trump said. “But it’s a ― I don’t even know what it is.

— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 21, 2015. With a 3.7 billion dollar net worth according to a Forbes investigation, he is by far the wealthiest man to ever take office. However, there are two other Presidents who chose to forgo the salary of the office.
While he is not donating his salary right now, the vice president could forgo a portion of his salary in the future should his staff face furloughs down the road. The vice president is committed to sharing the burden of the sequester with his staff, an aide to the vice president said. Biden earns a salary of $230,700 a year as vice president, but his net worth is much lower than the president and some Cabinet members who have decided to donate a portion of their salary.
Because the inflatable is on the water more than in the water, it is pushed around more easily by the wind. Folding Kayaks Designed for portability, folding kayaks can be transported on planes or trains with security. A framework of metal or wooden struts locks together and a fabric covering is stretched over.
I have an exact copy of an original hunting kayak from the East Greenland village of Angmagssalik. It is an extreme sea kayak, 18 ft long with only 19 in. beam, unstable minimum wetted surface cross section, and is stealth with only an inch free-board to fool the seals, and me. It is the closest thing to a paddled submarine with the stern actually sucked under at higher speeds -- weird.
A typical performance kayak would be 18-19 ft long with 20 to 22 in beam requiring fair paddling skills. For all around kayaks 17-18 feet length and 24-26 in. beam is popular. The additional drag of a shorter/wider boat comes in at higher speeds and its drag might actually be less at lower speeds.
The focus in our club is on white water kayaking and this article is for you only if you are developing a deeper interest in sea kayaking and have not yet read all the books about it, otherwise it will put you to sleep.
Length: In general, longer kayaks are faster on the water and have greater cargo capacity. They are also slower to turn, and heavier. Beam: This refers to the width of the kayak at its widest point. A wide beam gives more stability, and more room for gear. As width increases, however, speed and ease of paddling decrease. Chine: This refers to a corner, or edge, in the cross-section of a hull.
Kayaks are available in a variety of models with specific designs for different water conditions. In choosing a kayak, first you'll need to decide what type of water you'll be paddling in - inland lakes, flatwater streams, ocean coast or whitewater rivers.
Sit-on-Tops This is an open kayak, with no cockpit to climb into. Very stable and fun, but not good for extended trips as there's no dry storage space. Sit-on-tops are great for snorkeling or swimming, as they provide a stable platform. It's easy to roll off into the water, and easy to climb back on.
If you are new to Kayaking or Canoeing, you should know some of the terms associated with it. Your Kayak, Canoe experience will be better if you know your way around your watercraft. abeam Perpendicular to the keel line of a boat at the midpoint or amidships. aft Toward the stern of a canoe or kayak.
In the last installment on kayak surfing in our KaNews, Apr. 98, I wrote about waves and how to get started in surfing. Playing in the surf zone not only builds kayaking skills but waves become friends instead of adversaries, and that is important for sea kayakers.
If applied amidships, the hull slides sideways; if applied at the bow or stern, the boat turns toward the blade. drop A steep, sudden change in the level of a river. A waterfall is an extreme drop. dry bag A waterproof bag in a canoe or kayak, used to hold gear that should be kept dry.

That's a shame :/ I think it's a very personal thing with these kind of low-carb products, I've never had a problem with Mama Lupe's tortillas, but saying that I know some people who say artificial sweeteners in stuff like Diet Coke has kicked them out.
The perfect alkaline Keto diet. According to WebMd, the perfect alkaline diet “discourages eating acid-promoting foods, which include meat, fish, poultry, dairy products, processed foods, white sugar, white flour, and caffeine.”. As you can see, the perfect pH balanced diet is very vegetarian and very anti-meat.
Even many of those who think a ketogenic diet is a good thing just assume that a very low-carbohydrate diet (under about 50 net grams of carbohydrate) is ketogenic. On the other hand, many people have found that monitoring their ketones, at least for a while, provides valuable information.
They are a good place to get an idea of what a ketogenic diet could look like. However, they are going to be too high in protein for some people to remain in ketosis, and some of them may be a little high in carb if you have very poor carb tolerance. Ketogenic diets always have to be tailored to the individual.
If the diet is changed from one that is high in carbohydrates to one that does not provide sufficient carbohydrate to replenish glycogen stores, the body goes through a set of stages to enter ketosis.
[rant]Mama Lupe's Low Carb Tortillas knocked me out of ketosis (blood measurement) (self.keto) submitted 2 years ago by ionchannels37/M/5'8 SW: 234 CW: 184 GW: 150. I have been in ketosis for about 1 month straight, about 2 mM fasting blood ketone levels and purple on the ketostix. Suddenly this weekend I am no longer in ketosis - negative reading on ketostix and below the limits of detection for the blood ketone meter. The only thing I have done differently is eaten 4 Mama Lupe's low carb tortillas. Each supposedly has 7 grams of carbs and 4 grams of fiber (3 g net).
A keto diet is full of meat and can naturally lower your pH, which can do a whole host of bad things to your body. When your body is acidic, you can actually breed cancer rather than scaring it away, (and one of my main reasons for going keto is to scare cancer away!). Thankfully, there are lots of pH balancing foods on the keto diet. Three years ago I went to a natural health clinic where they tested my pH.
Protein - When people first reduce carbohydrates in their diets, it doesn't seem as though the amount of protein they eat is as important to ketosis as it often becomes later on. For example, people on the Atkins diet often eat fairly large amounts of protein in the early stages and remain in ketosis.
In What is a Low-Carb Diet?, I outline three approaches to low-carb eating, only one of which focuses on ketosis as a goal throughout the diet. Diets such as the Atkins Diet start out as a very low-carb ketogenic diet, but as people add carbohydrate, many or most will be eating too much carbohydrate to be in ketosis. It is probably more accurate to talk about the degree to which a diet is ketogenic rather than whether or not a diet is ketogenic.
What also contributes is a diet full o’ meat, amongst other things. When your pH is low, you also absorb 20% less oxygen too; It’s not healthy. Adding pH balancing foods to your diet can help, and is pretty much necessary for a balanced keto diet.

→ In other words, place names. Sydney, Australia is a formal region. A functional region exists because a specific function is present within the region (for example, an area covered by a particular sales force or a rail network). → Other examples are tourism in Hawaii, the subway in NY, an industrial plant in a rural area, farming in the Midwest.
Formal regions are different from functional regions because functional regions often have a focal point, such as a city, that is the center of the region, and the rest of the region is built around that focal point. Examples of functional regions include New York City and Los Angeles.

Best Answer: A formal region is typically defined by a government or administrative group for the purpose of defining boundaries; these can include political entities such as the United States, County Limerick, or Marseilles, and physical regions such as the Lake District, the Blue Ridge Mountains, or the Korea Strait.
Other formal regions include climate regions (e.g., areas with a Mediterranean climate), landform regions (e.g., the Ridge and Valley and Piedmont regions of Pennsylvania), and economic regions (e.g., the wheat belt of Kansas, the citrus-growing areas of south Texas, and the irrigated farmlands of the Central Valley of California).

Enforceability of “Time Is of the Essence” Provisions in Civil-Law Jurisdictions. At the 2008 ABA annual meeting I appeared on a panel with Kevin Kyte, partner at the Montreal office of Stikeman Elliott. Kevin’s topic was things to bear in mind when drafting contracts governed by the law of a civil-law jurisdiction.
Therefore, coders can use an E/M visit's time component and, potentially, other codes. For example, if the physician spends 30 minutes with the patient, with half of that spent on counseling, code the visit as CPT 99214 ( physicians typically spend 25 minutes face-to-face with the patient and/or family), Walker says.
n the world of coding, time is perplex-. ing. On the one hand, time is built. into the evaluation and management. (E/M) codes, so physicians are told to. base their E/M code selection on the histo-. ry, exam and medical decision-making ele-. ments, not on time spent.

The modern view held by most courts is that a party's failure to meet the conditions of a time is of the essence provision amounts to a material breach of the contract. And, alternatively, most courts will not consider the timing as crucial if this language is left out.
Second, even if it’s clear what performance it applies to, the phrase is silent as to the exact consequences of untimely performance. Third, you see time is of the essence provisions even in contracts that use liquidated-damages provisions and express termination provisions to specify the consequences of delay. Such specific provisions should override a generic time is of the essence provision.
However, even when a time is of the essence clause is included in a contract, a court may give the breaching party time to cure (fix) the breach, or may even disregard the provision completely if other evidence indicates that it would be unfair to enforce the time is of the essence clause or shows that the parties really didn't intend for the ...
Jackson suggests coding either 99213 or 99214. The medical-complexity level is certainly there to justify those codes, Jackson says. Because the physician usually spends a lot of time counseling at this appointment, you will probably use the E/M visit's time component to determine the appropriate code.
Code 99358 is used for the ﬁrst 30 minutes. to an hour of service, and code 99359 is. used for each additional 30 minutes or for. the ﬁnal 15 to 30 minutes on a given day. Finally, prolonged physician services can. be reported by attaching the -21 modiﬁer to. the E/M code.
Sometimes evaluations take longer and can be coded 99215 ( physicians typically spend 40 minutes face-to-face with the patient and/or family). In the latter case, the visit must be at least 40 minutes with half the time spent counseling. Documentation of time spent is critical.
1 The Denture Fountain of Youth®. 2  Implant Dentures. 3  Partial Dentures and Dental Bridges.  Single-Arch Dentures (Replacing either the top or the bottom teeth, but leaving the natural teeth in your other arch)
1 If a natural tooth is failing or about to fail.  If a tooth has severe periodontal disease (gum disease) that has eroded the bone that supports the teeth. Sometimes in these cases, it is preferable to extract the teeth; eliminate the disease and infection and replace the teeth with a dental implant.
When should a tooth be extracted and replaced with a dental implant? There are times when it makes sense to extract a tooth and replace it with a dental implant. 1  If a natural tooth is failing or about to fail.  If a tooth has severe periodontal disease (gum disease) that has eroded the bone that supports the teeth.
Dental implants that can be placed to accept a full arch of teeth. This is done by strategically placing implants along the upper or lower jaw and attaching a denture-like attachment over abutments on the implant posts. Once placed, a full arch using implants will feel and perform like natural teeth.
The only way to know the best solution for your dentures is to talk to a denture dentist like Dr. Paul Hahn or Dr. Adam Hahn. To schedule an appointment, please call 803-781-9090 or email Smile Columbia Dentistry in Columbia, SC today.
For a full arch tooth replacement with dental implants there are various methods that will create a superior result. When there is bone loss and we wish to have this tissue back we can incorporate the tissue replacement with pink areas attached to the dental implant crowns.
Single Arch Dentures. If you’re considering dentures, you may not need all your teeth replaced. Sometimes you may have good or reasonably good teeth in one arch, while the other teeth need to be replaced. Typically, we will replace the top arch, leaving the lower arch alone, or restoring it to good health. Because your natural teeth are normally better than any replacement option, this may be beneficial for you.
Full Arch Dental Implants (Removable Prosthetics - Implant Supported) Implant supported dentures sit on 4 or more implants. They are classified as implant supported because the denture sits entirely on the dental implant fixtures, and only lightly touch the soft tissue (gums).
If you are missing one or more teeth and in general good health you are a candidate for dental implant treatment. There are a few qualifying factors that need to be addressed: 1  Quality and quantity of available bone for implant placement.  Uncontrollable diabetes or other medical conditions.
Implant retained dentures generally consist of two dental implants that act as anchors to prevent dentures as moving. They are classified as Implant retained because the denture is still supported by the soft tissue (gums). The two implants can retain the dentures with different attachments. 1.

Currants are glossy red or black berries that grow on thornless upright shrubs. To be classified as a currant, the bush must be in the genus Ribes. Native to the Northern Hemisphere, these plants have been cultivated throughout Europe and Asia for centuries.
Adaptation: Currants grow best in summer humid, cool regions with great winter chilling. They are best adapted to USDA Hardiness Zones 3 through 5, although in California they are fairly productive in the coolest parts of the San Francisco Bay Area and coastal northern California.
Answer Wiki. Supermarket currants are not made from currant berries. They are raisins made from small grapes originally grown on the Greek island of Corinth. Through mispronunciation, Corinth became currant. When growing moved to the Greek island of Zante, they tried changing the name to Zante raisins or Zante currants, but it was too late.
Flowers: Currant flowers are borne toward the bases of one-year old stems and on spurs on older stems. They appear in early spring with new growth. Each flower bud opens to number of flowers (up to 20), joined together on a delicate, drooping 5 - 6 inch stem, called a strig.
Raisins, sultanas, and currants are small, sweet dried fruits that are used in many of the same ways, but they have their own unique traits.
Raisins, sultanas, and Zante currants are all sweet dried fruits that stem from different varieties of vine-grown grapes, while currants really are a fresh bush-grown berry that is tart rather than sweet. Currants are also sold dried, but they're not as readily available as sultanas and raisins.
a small seedless raisin, produced chiefly in California and in the Levant, and used in cookery and confectionery. 2. the small, edible, acid, round fruit or berry of certain wild or cultivated shrubs of the genus Ribes. 3. the shrub itself. 4. any of various similar fruits or shrubs. Origin of currant.
The Difference Between Raisins, Sultanas, and Currants. While all three are types of dried fruit and used in similar ways, there are several things that set raisins, sultanas, and dried currants (both true currants and Zante currants) apart from each other.
The best time for currants is late spring through late summer. The berries should be plump, glossy and a little bit firm when they are purchased, and they can be stored for as long as three days under refrigeration. The fresh, tart flavor is excellent in fresh fruit dishes and can be used to make jams and preserves.
Species: Red, pink and white currants belong to three European species (Ribes rubrum, R. petraeum, R. sativum). Black currants are related to European (R. nigrum) and Asian (R. ussuriense) species.

Unity has several kinds of special folders. One of them is the Resources folder. Simple concept of storing assets is well-explained in the official documentation: Generally, you create instances of assets in a scene to use them in gameplay but Unity also lets you load assets on demand from a script.

Messages: 2,936. Having an issue trying to load a text file using Resources.Load. I have a Resources folder in my Assets and inside it is a file called test_prn (with no extension). I'm using this code to test: Code (csharp): private void Start() {. var PrnFile = Resources.Load(test_prn) as TextAsset; Debug.Log(PrnFile.text); }.
Method 1: Read a text file embedded in the game’s resources. The simplest technique is to read a file that Unity has compiled into your game, just as it does for the other game assets like textures, sounds, and models. This is simple because Unity encrypts the file into your game bundle automatically.
Only objects of type T will be returned. The path is relative to any Resources folder inside the Assets folder of your project, extensions must be omitted. Note: All asset names and paths in Unity use forward slashes, paths using backslashes will not work.
Place the textfile (in this example, “puzzles.txt”) in the Resources folder of your Unity project. Unity will automatically package it into your game. To read it, your script just uses Unity’s built-in Resources class: FileInfo theSourceFile = null; StringReader reader = null; TextAsset puzdata = (TextAsset)Resources.Load(puzzles, typeof(TextAsset)); // puzdata.text is a string containing the whole file.
The Editor folder name is a special name which allows your scripts access to the Unity Editor Scripting API. If your script uses any classes or functionality from the UnityEditor namespace, it has to be placed in a folder called Editor. Scripts inside an Editor folder will not be included in your game's build.

Loads an asset stored at path in a Resources folder. Returns the asset at path if it can be found otherwise returns null. Only objects of type will be returned if this parameter is supplied. The path is relative to any Resources folder inside the Assets folder of your project, extensions must be omitted. Note: All asset names and paths in Unity use forward slashes, paths using backslashes will not work.
These assets can then be loaded using the Resources.Load function. Still the reason why we might want to use the Resources folder may be a little confusing. First you have to understand how Unity build process is works and how Unity is able to access game assets.

An important factor in social learning theory is the concept of reciprocal determinism. This notion states that just as an individual's behavior is influenced by the environment, the environment is also influenced by the individual's behavior.
Maybe you have learned from observing a teacher, friend, or supervisor. We acquire new knowledge and skills from a variety of methods. This lesson will introduce the concepts of the social-cognitive theory, which focuses on the learning that occurs within a social context.
Pick up a standard psychology textbook – especially from the 1960s and 1970s and you will probably find learning defined as a change in behaviour. In other words, learning is approached as an outcome – the end product of some process. It can be recognized or seen.

1 Learning as making sense or abstracting meaning. Learning involves relating parts of the subject matter to each other and to the real world.  Learning as interpreting and understanding reality in a different way. Learning involves comprehending the world by reinterpreting knowledge.
1 Describe the social-cognitive theory and its assumptions. 2  Define model and explain the importance of modeling in the social-cognitive theory.  Identify the different types of models, what makes an effective model and what functions models may serve.
So, let's summarize what we've discussed. The social-cognitive theory focuses on the learning that occurs within a social context. Within this social context, learners observe new behaviors and skills from a model.
The social-cognitive theory is a theoretical perspective in which learning by observing others is the focus of study. Social-cognitive theory is grounded by several basic assumptions. One is that people can learn by observing others. Learners can acquire new behaviors and knowledge by simply observing a model.
This lack of attention to the nature of learning inevitably leads to an impoverishment of education. It isn’t simply that the process is less effective as a result, but what passes for education can actually diminish well-being. Here we begin by examining learning as a product and as a process.
Social learning theory. Social learning theory (Albert Bandura) posits that learning is a cognitive process that takes place in a social context and can occur purely through observation or direct instruction, even in the absence of motor reproduction or direct reinforcement.

Electricity stored in a battery is an example of electrical potential energy. You can use the energy in the battery to power a flashlight, for example. When you switch on a flashlight, the battery inside begins to supply electrical energy to the lamp, making it give off light.
The electric power in a circuit is equal to the voltage × the current (in other words: watts = volts × amps). So if you have a 100-watt (100 W) light and you know your electricity supply is rated as 120 volts (typical household voltage in the United States), the current flowing must be 100/120 = 0.8 amps.
Electricity is the most versatile energy source that we have; it is also one of the newest: homes and businesses have been using it for not much more than a hundred years.
This means that the coulomb is defined as the amount of charge that passes through a surface when a current of one ampere ampère flows for one. [Second = C]. As When i visualize, Current i see things. Moving i see them moving in a. direction
Electricity is a type of energy that can build up in one place or flow from one place to another. When electricity gathers in one place it is known as static electricity (the word static means something that does not move); electricity that moves from one place to another is called current electricity.
Electricity is the set of physical phenomena associated with the presence and flow of electric charge. Electricity gives a wide variety of well-known effects, such as lightning, static electricity, electromagnetic induction and electric current. In addition, electricity permits the creation and reception of electromagnetic radiation such as radio waves.
definitions. Electric current is defined as the rate at which charge flows through a surface (the cross section of a wire, for example). Despite referring to many different things, the word current is often used by itself instead of the longer, more formal electric current.

The inductor is a conductor, usually a coil of wire, that stores energy in a magnetic field in response to the current through it. When the current changes, the magnetic field does too, inducing a voltage between the ends of the conductor.
An electromagnet is a magnet that can be switched on and off with electricity. When the current flows, it works like a magnet; when the current stops, it goes back to being an ordinary, unmagnetized piece of steel. Scrapyard cranes pick up bits of metal junk by switching the magnet on.
Synopsis. Thomas Wolfe was born in October 1900 in Asheville, North Carolina. He first attended the University of North Carolina and then Harvard University before moving to New York City in 1923.
A: Thomas Wolfe was an American novelist who lived from 1900-1938 (for more detailed biographical info, check out the “Thomas Wolfe Biography” section of this website), contemporary of F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway.
“I had not yet learned that one cannot really be superior without humility and tolerance and human understanding. I did not yet know that in order to belong to a rare and higher breed one must first develop the true power and talent of selfless immolation.”. ― Thomas Wolfe, You Can't Go Home Again.
Wolfe could not recover his health, and he died at Johns Hopkins of tuberculosis of the brain shortly before his 38th birthday. After Wolfe's death, Edward Aswell, Wolfe's Harper editor, assembled from the manuscripts left behind the novels The Web and the Rock (1939) and You Can't Go Home Again (1940).
Early Years. Thomas Wolfe was born on October 3, 1900, in Asheville, North Carolina, to a stonecutter father and a mother who owned a boardinghouse. After attending a private prep school, Wolfe enrolled in the University of North Carolina in 1916. There he began his writing career, penning and acting in several one-act plays.
In saying this, I'm not like those others you complain about: you know damn well I understand what you did and why you had to do it. But just the same, there were some things that you did not have to do -- and you'd have had a better book if you hadn't done them.”. ― Thomas Wolfe, You Can't Go Home Again.
He was only 37 years old when he died, yet he provided a great body of work during his lifetime. He was born in Asheville, NC on October 3, 1900 to Julia Westall Wolfe and William Oliver Wolfe. He is known for his sweeping prose style and descriptive abilities. He is in no way affiliated or connected to today’s modern writer Tom Wolfe. He was highly educated–first in private school in Asheville, NC, then graduated from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and graduated from Harvard.
A: Thomas Wolfe was over 6 foot 6 inches tall. He had brown hair and eyes. His hands were large, and he had a callus worn on one of his fingers from clutching his pencil to handwrite his manuscripts.
And, most important of all for one who had taken so long to grow up, he thought he had learned not to be the slave of his emotions.”. ― Thomas Wolfe, You Can't Go Home Again. Like. “Perhaps this is our strange and haunting paradox here in America -- that we are fixed and certain only when we are in movement.
“Something has spoken to me in the night...and told me that I shall die, I know not where. Saying: [Death is] to lose the earth you know for greater knowing; to lose the life you have, for greater life; to leave the friends you loved, for greater loving; to find a land more kind than home, more large than earth.”. ― Thomas Wolfe, You Can't Go Home Again.

This is one reason why it is not a good idea to rely on a general list of preferred Koala food trees. Leaving out the key species from tree plantings to restore Koala habitat, could be a waste of time and effort.
The two most important factors which make habitats suitable are (1) the presence of tree species preferred by Koalas (usually eucalypts, but also some non-eucalypts) growing in particular associations on suitable soils with adequate rainfall and (2) the presence of other Koalas.

'Habitat' refers to the types of bushland that Koalas like to live in. They are found in a range of habitats, from coastal islands and tall eucalypt forests to low woodlands inland.

Before we can find ways to solve some of the Koala's problems, it is important first to understand the relationship between the Koala and its environment. To best appreciate the effect of habitat loss on Koalas, imagine yourself as a Koala and how you would feel in a similar situation.
Unless they have access to a safe haven of undisturbed habitat large enough to support a Koala colony, their days as suburban Koalas are numbered. Scientists have found that Koalas facing these sorts of problems are more prone to disease. They also have a lower rate of reproduction.
The almost president has become the ultimate Davos Man, a moral entrepreneur and richer than Mitt Romney. The house in Nashville is gleaming white, with symmetrical wings and four twenty-foot-high Victorian columns. Under the soaring portico stands Al Gore, dressed in his casual uniforma button-down blue dress shirt, jeans, and cowboy boots. This is Gore’s White House, a 10,000-square-foot mansion he and Tipper renovated in 2007.
Surrounding flowers and shrubs native to the area enable the property to blend into the surrounding rural landscape. House #1 is located in the ultra-wealthy enclave of Nashville called Belle Meade; it is Al Gore’s house. House #2 is on a ranch near Crawford, Texas ; it is the residence of George W. Bush. Filed Under: Blog, Featured, Homes.
Short and sweet, there’s a fair bit of truth to the e-mail: Al Gore’s Nashville mansion is something of the energy-gobbler the e-mail depicts, while President Bush’s Crawford ranch is more the model of responsible resource use the juxtaposition portrays it to.
Al Jazeera had the money to pay Gore $500 million because of fossil fuels. Lauer asked Gore if he saw a contradiction in his position. While Gore said he understands the criticism, he disagrees with it because Al Jazeera is a great network and has won major awards.

HOUSE # 1 (20 room energy guzzling mansion) is outside of Nashville, Tennessee. It is the abode of that renowned environmentalist (and filmmaker) Al Gore. HOUSE # 2 (model eco-friendly house) is on a ranch near Crawford, Texas. Also known as “the Texas White House,” it is the private residence of the President of the United States, George W. Bush.
Former Vice President Al Gore, photographed in California in 2010. Credit Amanda Marsalis/Trunk Archive, 2010. NASHVILLE — Al Gore wants to make a point about cellphones, and he has a helpful set of slides on his laptop.
Yes, Al Gore appears to be very comfortable in selling out his principles for a $100 million profit. And at least he “gets” the criticism. He disagrees that it is hypocrisy, apparently on the basis that he doesn’t like the word hypocrisy.

Healthy kidneys remove wastes and excess fluid from the blood. Blood and urine tests show how well the kidneys are doing their job and how quickly body wastes are being removed. Urine tests can also detect whether the kidneys are leaking abnormal amounts of protein, a sign of kidney damage. Here's a quick guide to the tests used to measure kidney function. Blood Tests
a JustAnswer user. Proteinuria (protein in the urine) can be related to any number of factors in children, but it can also be a transient finding that resolves on its own without any further complications. It is measured on a scale to 4+ (by this sort of test, at least), with 1+ being the least amount of protein. Proteinuria can be caused by a number of different factors. Sometimes, after a bacterial or viral infection the kidneys can become irritated and this can lead to proteinuria.
If two or more urinalyses show protein in the urine, the next step is to determine how much protein is in the urine. This can be measured from: A single urine sample collected at any time (a common and convenient method). Urine that has been collected over 24 hours (a more exact but somewhat inconvenient method).
Testing for protein in a pregnant woman's urine (proteinuria) helps care providers to make sure kidney function is normal, as well as making sure there are no other conditions that may need further investigation.
People with proteinuria have urine containing an abnormal amount of protein. The condition is often a sign of kidney disease. Healthy kidneys do not allow a significant amount of protein to pass through their filters. But filters damaged by kidney disease may let proteins such as albumin leak from the blood into the urine. Proteinuria can also be a result of overproduction of proteins by the body.
If there is a large amount of protein in the first sample, repeat testing will be ordered. If increased levels of urine protein are observed in follow-up specimens, then a 24-hour urine protein may be ordered along with certain blood tests.

Schizophrenia is a brain-based disease whose diagnosis arises in large part from clinical observations of how and what people communicate through language. The study of language and schizophrenia has a long history dating back to the earliest phenomenological descriptions of the disorder. These early reports have been enriched in recent years by empirical, theoretical, and methodological advances in the fields of psycholinguistics and cognitive neuroscience.
Schizophrenia occurs at roughly 10% of people who have a first-degree relative with the disorder, such as a parent or sibling. The highest risk occurs when an identical twin is diagnosed with schizophrenia. The unaffected twin has a roughly 50% chance of developing the disorder. Environment.

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language for describing the rendering of HTML and XML documents on screen, on paper, in speech, etc. It uses color-related properties and values to color the text, backgrounds, borders, and other parts of elements in a document. The computed value for basic color keywords, RGB hex values and extended color keywords is the equivalent triplet of numerical RGB values, e.g. six digit hex value or rgb(...) functional value, with an alpha value of 1.
With Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) work, more ways of defining color have come into play, including another set of named colors.

Specific models are termed stereo plug, mini-stereo, mini jack, headphone jack and microphone jack, or are referred to by size, i.e. 3.5mm or 6.35mm. In the UK, the terms jack plug and jack socket are commonly used for the respective male and female phone connectors.
Q: plugging speakers into headphone jack on iMac. I tried to plug in audio engine a5+ speakers into the headphone jack of my iMac and it doesn't work. The speakers work with my iPhone but not iMac. Headphones work with the iMac, so I know the problem is not that.
Aug 1, 2014, 9:18 PM. I found a fix to the problem, no adapter necessary. I had the exact same problem. This is really wierd but to make the computer recognize BOTH microphones at the same time, what you do is you need to uninstall the Realtek High Definition Audio Driver.
Plugging in a headset, microphone or speakers. Speakers, microphones and headsets have one of two types of plug: mini jack plugs or a USB plug. Mini-jack plugs look like typical headphone plugs. You'll have two plugs which have corresponding ports on your computer. Mini jacks come in different styles. Some are color-coded with one pink or black with a pink band and one green or black with a green band. Others have symbols with a microphone symbol on one jack and a headphone symbol on the other.
A phone connector, also known as phone jack, audio jack, headphone jack or jack plug, is a common family of electrical connector typically used for analog signals, primarily audio. It is cylindrical in shape, typically with two, three, four and, recently, five contacts.

There are 2 solutions to make full use of the port: 1  Obtain a headset / microphone with combo jack or. 2  Purchase a Y adapter that can connect your current headphone with separate mic and speaker back to the system audio combo jack.
Audio combo jack vs headphone/earphone with mic and speaker connector. Question. I see the audio combo jack in my T510 (identified as number 6 in the image above), but I've used a regular headphone in it without plugging in the mic connector. How do I hook up a regular microphone - does the port know the difference between 2- or 3-conductor microphone plug and a stereo headphone plug?
Before my computer only noticed the 2- Realtek High Definition Audio, and when I plugged in my headphones it still only displayed one and just switched over to the mic of the headset. Now that I uninstalled the driver, it notices the two different mic's and you can set as default. An adapter is necessary. There is only one physical jack on the computer (or in my case on the smartphone). Any software changes will not help.
i need to be able to plug in speakers and headphones to my computer and i know that you can switch the settings for the microphone jack to use it as a headphone jack. i was told to try downloading realtek audio manager which i did but the input jacks did not show up on the right like they were supposed to, it actually didn't give me any management ...
In other words, you will essentially use If…then logic statements to build powerful processes that solve your real-life business problems. If you would like to begin learning this and other advanced features of Excel, a good place to start is an advanced online course in Excel. In this guide, we will learn more about what the IF function does, how to use it, and how to get the most out of it by including it within larger formulas. Background on the IF function Like most of the functions you are familiar with in Excel, the IF function delivers an output to a single cell, as opposed to a range of cells (as would be the case for an array function). In using it to process multiple entries throughout a spreadsheet, you construct it for a single cell and then copy it down to additional cells in a range.
Question: In Microsoft Excel, I'm trying to use the IF function to return 0 if cell A1 is either < 150,000 or > 250,000. Otherwise, it should return A1.
So, if you follow the logic of this chart, you’ll see that we we can use two IF functions to deliver three possible outcomes. The second of these functions is set off by a “false” outcome for the first. If you apply that to an Excel formula, it takes the following form:
Using the data in the spreadsheet, you can then complete the formula, which should look as follows: =IF(AND(B1+460>A$1,B1+460<A$2),”OK”,IF(B1+460>A$2, “High”,”Low”)) Copying this down from your first row to the remaining ones, you should have one of each result.
Question: I have been looking at your Excel IF, AND and OR sections and found this very helpful, however I cannot find the right way to write a formula to express if C2 is either 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 and F2 is F and F3 is either D,F,B,L,R,C then give a value of 1 if not then 0.
In this example, the formula will return 0 if cell A1 was either less than 150,000 or greater than 250,000. Otherwise, it will return the value in cell A1. Question: In Microsoft Excel, I'm trying to use the IF function to return 25 if cell A1 > 100 and cell B1 < 200. Otherwise, it should return 0. Answer: You can use the AND function to perform an AND condition in the IF function as follows:
If column B = Ross and column C = 8 then in cell AB of that row I want it to show 2013, If column B = Block and column C = 9 then in cell AB of that row I want it to show 2012. Answer:You can create your Excel formula using nested IF functions with the AND function.
Excel If Then Statements: Getting the Most Out of the IF Function. November 12, 2013 by. When you really get to know the advanced functions in Microsoft Excel, one function that you will no doubt begin to use frequently is the IF function.
So for the specific problem in this example, the formula is this: =IF(B1+250=500,“OK”,IF(B1+250>500,“High”,“Low”)) Notice that the second IF function is taking the place of the “value if false” result for the first IF function.
Answer: In cell C1, you can use the following Excel formula with 3 nested IF functions: =IF(B1=0,A1/2, IF(B1=1,(A1/2)*0.2, IF(D1=1,(A1/2)-5,))) Please note that if none of the conditions are met, the Excel formula will return  as the result.
So, scraper beware! There have been many court cases where web scraping turned into felony offenses. One case involved an online activist who scraped the MIT website and ultimately downloaded millions of academic articles. This guy is now free on bond, but faces dozens of years in prison and $1 million if convicted.
The use described in the question, using data to make graphics for example, puts forth the assumption that the web scraping doesn't involve unauthorized reproduction of copyrighted content - just the use of the data itself, in some transformative manner.
Web scraping (web harvesting or web data extraction) is data scraping used for extracting data from websites. Web scraping software may access the World Wide Web directly using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol, or through a web browser.
So in terms of legal action against web scraping, Tresspass to Chattels no longer applied, and things were back to square one. This began a period in which the courts consistently rejected Terms of Service as a valid means of prohibiting scrapers, including cases like Perfect 10 v. Google, and Cvent v. Eventbrite.
There are lots of reasons people (or companies) want to scrape websites, and there are tons of web scraping applications available today. A quick Internet search will yield numerous web scraping tools written in just about any programming language you prefer.
Web scraping a web page involves fetching it and extracting from it. Fetching is the downloading of a page (which a browser does when you view the page). Therefore, web crawling is a main component of web scraping, to fetch pages for later processing. Once fetched, then extraction can take place.
First things first: I am not a lawyer and these comments are solely based on my experience working at Scrapinghub, please seek legal assistance accordingly. Here are a few things to consider when scraping public data from websites (note that the following addresses only US law): 1  As long as they don't crawl at a disruptive rate, scrapers do not breach any contract (in the form of terms of use) or commit a crime (as defined in the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act).
Web Scraping and You: A Legal Primer for One of IT’s Most Useful Tools. September 25, 2016. A look into the legality of one of the best ways to aggregate content from across the internet, web scraping. Disclaimer: This post discusses general legal issues, but it does not constitute legal advice in any respect.
Web scraping is used for contact scraping, and as a component of applications used for web indexing, data mining, online price change monitoring and price comparison, product review scraping (to watch the competition), gathering real estate listings, weather data monitoring, website change detection, research, tracking online presence and reputation ...
Web scraping rides a fine line between collecting information and stealing information. Most websites have a copyright disclosure statement that legally protects their website information. It's up to the reader/user/scraper to read these disclosure statements and follow along legally and ethically.
Aside from the hokey honor societies like Golden Key I am excluding, there are two major types of honor society you can join: major-specific like Beta Alpha Psi which is specific to accounting majors, and large, interdisciplinary honor societies like Phi Kappa Phi and Omicron Delta Kappa.
Based on these experiences, whenever any student asks me whether they should join an honor society -- the ones which are not supposed to be scams, like Phi Beta Kappa -- I say I do not advise you to do it if you have to pay more than the most negligible amount of money.
The National Honor Society (NHS) and National Junior Honor Society (NJHS) are the nation's premier organizations established to recognize outstanding high school and middle level students. More than just an honor roll, NHS and NJHS serve to honor those students who have demonstrated excellence in the areas of Scholarship, Leadership, Service, and Character (and Citizenship for NJHS).

By the way, the chief benefit of the National Honor Society is college acceptance and financial packages. There is an emphasis on academics and service that are prerequisites for membership. The url you provide for this is correct: http://www.nhs.org.
Ah yes, the always exciting you are so awesome, here join my honor society!. My method is to simply google name of honor soceity scam. You would be amazed at how much info is out there already answering your questions for you. To be honest, most honor society's are mostly just scams.
There are three metrics I use to see if a 'exclusive' society is a scam or not. 1  If they are imprecise when it comes to why I was invited. Because of your grades or a nomination is pretty weak honestly. 2  Do they want me to pay money? It's true a lot of honor societies may have a entrance or membership fee.
What does the National Honor Society do for me? I have been invited for induction into the Alpha Sigma Lambda (ASL) Chapter of the National Honor Society. My grades are good, all A's in everything now for two years and Dean'sList every semester but what does the NHS do for me in reality?

According to the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, published in 1994 (DSM-IV), dysthymia is a serious state of chronic depression, which persists for at least two years (one year for children and adolescents). Dysthymia is less acute and severe than major depressive disorder. As dysthymia is a chronic disorder, sufferers may experience symptoms for many years before it is diagnosed, if diagnosis occurs at all.
In the DSM-5, dysthymia is replaced by persistent depressive disorder (PDD). This new condition includes both chronic major depressive disorder and the previous dysthymic disorder. The reason for this change is that there was no evidence for meaningful differences between these two conditions.

Some Part C plans provide significant coverage beyond what you get in Parts A and B - including, in some cases, prescription drug coverage - but not all. The better ones basically function like Medigap policies but are administered by Medicare rather than being wholly run by private insurance companies.
As of the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003, most Medicare+Choice plans were re-branded as Medicare Advantage (MA) plans (though MA is a government term and might not be visible to the Part C health plan beneficiary).
By continuing to use this site, you are agreeing to the new Privacy Policy and Terms of Service. Medicare Part C is known as Medicare Advantage. These are private plans run through Medicare that, by law, must at least be equivalent to regular Part A and Part B coverage. But there's lots of variation among Part C plans. Any given one may cover less of one thing and more of another than Parts A and B do.
Medicare Part C. An optional Medicare program (US) created under the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, which gives Medicare beneficiaries the option to receive their Medicare benefits through private health insurance plans, instead of through the original Medicare plan (Parts A and B).
A sample Medicare card. There are separate lines for basic Part A and Part B's supplementary medical coverage, each with its own date. There are no lines for Part C or D, which are additional supplemental policies th separate card is issued.
Medicare has four parts: Part A is Hospital Insurance. Part B is Medical Insurance. Medicare Part D covers many prescription drugs, though some are covered by Part B. In general, the distinction is based on whether or not the drugs are self administered.
United States Medicare is funded by a Payroll Tax, premiums and surtaxes from beneficiaries, and general revenue. It provides health insurance for Americans aged 65 and older who have worked and paid into the system through the payroll tax.
In the United States, Medicare is a national social insurance program, administered by the U.S. federal government since 1966, currently using about 30-50 private insurance companies across the United States under contract for administration.
Its three parts are: (1) Medicare Part A, which pays for hospital costs, (2) Medicare Part B, which covers outpatient costs, and (3) the new Medicare Part C (Medicare Plus Choice), which expands the types of health entities that beneficiaries can use to receive their care.

Statistically, the most dangerous places to drive are two-lane country roads, but for over-the-road truckers, it’s the curvy, the foggy, the snow-drowned stretches of major interstates where big accidents happen that stick in the memory for years to come.
Most Dangerous Roads in Knoxville, Tennessee. Knoxville, Tennessee, is generally considered a safe place to live. Just like any major city, however, some roads are simply more dangerous to travel. While everyone has an opinion as to which roads are the most dangerous, we have put together a list of the roads on which drivers should not drive. Every year, the roads in Knoxville and the surrounding area are surveyed to see which roads need the most attention. These are the roads that come up time and time again.
The Most Dangerous Roads in East Tennessee. Driving on dangerous roads is one of the easiest ways to end up in the hospital, confronting the dual specter of massive personal injury and car repair bills.
Luckily, Tennessee’s capital, Nashville, is nowhere close to being on this list, coming in as the 29th most dangerous city in the state. The other big cities in Tennessee – Memphis, Chattanooga, and Knoxville – were not so lucky. Instead of relying on speculation, we dug into the FBI crime data in order to identify the most dangerous places in Tennessee. The result is the following list of top ten most dangerous: Crossville (Photos)
The Most Dangerous Roads in East Tennessee. Mar 23, 2016 | Car Accidents. Driving on dangerous roads is one of the easiest ways to end up in the hospital, confronting the dual specter of massive personal injury and car repair bills.
Just past the truck brake-inspection station on infamous Monteagle Mountain, east-bound I-24 in Tennessee, the long dangerous downgrade begins. The ideal road, says America’s Road Team Captain Albert Adams, is “an interstate highway on a nice, sunny, 70-degree day with light traffic.”.
While I-44 in Missouri was named one of the most improved roads in the country in Overdrive magazine’s 2006 reader survey, its danger lies less in its structure than its environment, says Dora Colvin. “My husband hates I-44 because of the hills and the rain,” she says. “That road is quite dangerous.
The number of fatal car crashes — not traffic jams — places a main road in the Worst Highways category. Read this article to learn about the Top 10 Most Dangerous Highways by State in the United States to see if your state makes the list. Then, file away some tips on how to be a safer driver.
Chapman Highway. This is actually, by the numbers, the deadliest highway in East Tennessee — from 2008 to 2010, a whopping 24 drivers and passengers lost their lives on this quaint country road that winds through three major counties.
Joe Hinton Road. It’s hard to believe that a road less than 1 mile long could make the list of most dangerous roads in Knoxville. However, over 33 crashes occurred on Joe Hinton Road in a span of just two years. Of these, 18 were single car accidents, and four were head-on collisions.

A minority of researchers start the generation in the late 1970s. A 2014 report from Synchrony Financial describes Millennials as starting as early as 1976, and a 2009 report from MetLife defines the generation as being born between 1977 and 1994.
See also: List of millennia. A millennium (plural millennia or millenniums) is a period of time equal to 1000 years, also called kiloyears. It derives from the Latin mille, thousand, and annus, year. It is often, but not always, related to a particular dating system.
A period of a thousand years foretold in the Book of Revelation. During the millennium, those who have been faithful to Jesus and who have not worshiped the Antichrist will reign with Jesus over the Earth.
The majority researchers and demographers start the generation in the early 1980s. A 2009 McCrindle Research report from Australia uses 1980–1994 as Generation Y birth dates, starting with a recorded rise in birth rates, and fitting their newer definition of a generational span as 15 years.
In 2013, Time magazine ran a cover story titled Millennials: The Me Me Me Generation. Newsweek used the term Generation 9/11 to refer to young people who were between the ages of 10 and 20 years during the terrorist acts of 11 September 2001.
Thus each period of 1,000 years concludes with a year number with 3 zeroes, e.g., the first thousand years in the Western calendar included the year 1000. However, there are two viewpoints about how millennia should be thought of in practice.
The reason why the 3rd Millennium, also known as the 21st Century, starts in 2001 is because there was no year 0, i.e., there was no year AD 0, nor was there a year 0 BC. The year before the year AD 1 is defined as the year 1 BC, so the year 0 was skipped.
a thousand years; the name given to the era mentioned in Rev. 20:1-7. Some maintain that Christ will personally appear on earth for the purpose of establishing his kingdom at the beginning of this millennium. Those holding this view are usually called millenarians..
This is no doubt why, in the millennia of human existence in this region, no such route has developed naturally. Disingenuous Defenses of Netanyahu's Settlement Plans Lara Friedman December 16, 2012. I know that any religion can only grasp a portion of the reality of God they have come to know over millennia. How to Pray in the Public Square Gene Robinson May 10, 2014. In the millennia since swimming has been embedded in our culture, astounding claims have been made for its benefits.
Therefore, January 1, year 1, is defined to be the start of the 1st century and the start of the 1st Millennium. Because one Millennium is 1000 years, the first Millennium ends with year 1000. The next (2nd) Millennium starts 1000 years after the first, that is in year 1+1000 = 1001. And the 3rd one starts 1000 years later than the 2nd: 1001+1000 = 2001. The same procedure could be followed for centuries. See the tables below for more information.
There are two other types of lupus: Discoid lupus erythematosus, which mainly affects the skin. The symptoms of this form of lupus include a rash on the face, scalp, or elsewhere. The rash may last for days or years, and can recur. Drug-induced lupus, which is triggered by certain medications, usually goes away when the medicine is stopped.
There are other skin diseases that can occur in lupus and in other autoimmune diseases. Those include vasculitis and alopecia (hair loss). Mucosal ulcers in the nose or mouths are another common symptom of lupus. Like other symptoms, ulcers can come and go as the disease flares.
However, five percent or more of the people with this form of lupus may develop SLE later in life. Three types of skin lupus exist: chronic cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CCLE) (also known as Discoid Lupus Erythematosus [DLE]), subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (SCLE), and tumid lupus. A skin biopsy is usually obtained to diagnose skin lupus, and each form possesses its own characteristic lesions and pattern.
Curable Types of Lupus: 1  SLE of the joints. 2  Retinal vasculitis related to SLE. 3  Psychosis related to SLE.  Deep vein thrombosis related to 1  SLE. Acute ischemia related to 2  SLE. Drug( isoniazid, hydralazine, chlorpromazine) associated  SLE.
As many as 70% of people with lupus have some skin symptoms. The three main categories of lesions are chronic cutaneous (discoid) lupus, subacute cutaneous lupus, and acute cutaneous lupus. People with discoid lupus may exhibit thick, red scaly patches on the skin. Similarly, subacute cutaneous lupus manifests as red, scaly patches of skin but with distinct edges.
Types of Lupus. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (“SLE”) When people use the term “lupus,” they usually refer to systemic lupus erythematosus, or “SLE.” Throughout this website, the term “lupus” is used to signal systemic lupus, since SLE constitutes the most common form of the disease.
There are three main types of lupus skin disease: chronic cutaneous (discoid lupus), subacute cutaneous, and acute cutaneous. Some people with discoid lupus may never develop the systemic version of the disease (​systemic lupus erythematosus). And those with subacute cutaneous lupus may develop arthritis.
There are three different forms of lupus: 1  systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), the most serious form, may affect many parts of the body including joints, skin, kidney, lungs, heart and brain. 2  discoid or cutaneous lupus mainly affects the skin. 3  drug-induced lupus is caused by some prescription medicines.
There are three main types of lupus: 1  Systemic lupus erythematosus (eh-RITH-eh-muh-TOE-sus) is the most common form. 2  Discoid lupus erythematosus mainly affects the skin. 3  Drug-induced lupus is triggered by a few medicines.
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), also known simply as lupus, is an autoimmune disease in which the body's immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue in many parts of the body. Symptoms vary between people and may be mild to severe.

American Education Services Student Loans with a Debt Collection Agency American Education Services Student Loans with a Debt Collection Agency I cosigned a student loan for my daughter with American Education Services, and she thought it was deferred until she graduated.
AES is your student loan servicer. One thing that will be important to determine before putting together a strategy to resolve this situation is figuring out who your original lender is. AES is just a loan servicer, and they mainly deal with private student loans. Most often, the lender they are servicing for is the National Collegiate Trust. MRS Associates is also a collection agency that National Collegiate Trust uses often, so I would bet that’s who your original lender is.
I signed for a combined subsidized and unsubsidized student loans to pay for Master Degree in 2006. The loans amount mounted to $23,500.00 at an interests rate of 5.37% for the life of the loans. 5.37% of 23,500.00 = $1,300.00 more or less. I paid $110.00 for ten years = $13,000.00.
AES cooks the books. Department of Education knowingly allows AES to commit fraud on their behalf. Beware they are in bed together. You will never get assistance. This is legal fraud. The student loan debt numbers are not real if you minus the bogus fees and interest most student loans would be paid off 10 fold.
Anyone with questions or concerns about their student loans serviced by AES; loans placed with MRS Associates for collection; or trying to develop strategies to resolve loans with National Collegiate Trust, can post in the comments below for feedback.

Please make sure you check on any payment you send to your student loan. I have tried to send an extra payment on a monthly basis to try to pay off my debt, and after countless calls and speaking to managers I have come to accept I have to check on my loan minimum twice a month.
Speaking of flavor, I can’t believe I’m giving away my caper brine secret; but I decided it’s just too good to not share. The little splash of salty goodness does something that’s easier to taste than explain. Anyway, if you like shrimp and LOVE garlic, I hope you give this fast and delicious recipe a try soon.
Green olives can be used as a substitute for capers in recipes. But since they are much bigger than capers, it is better to take only half the number of olives while using it as a substitute. So for every four capers that you would add, use just two green olives. Cut the olives into small pieces and then add them instead of capers in cooking.
Anchovies are tiny silver fish, about 3 to 8 inches (7.5 to 20 cm) long, from the Mediterranean, especially the Basque area of Spain. Their lower jaw is shorter than their upper jaw. The fish are washed in a brine solution, then packed whole, heads and all, into large barrels and salted.
Many recipes call for rinsing the capers to remove some of the vinegar, which allows the true flavor of the caper to come through. You will also notice that capers are typically added to the dish toward the end of the cooking process. This allows the capers to keep their shape and maintain their signature taste. Caper Recipes You Must Try
Yeah, capers is the first place my mind went too. I have done that before, and the results really depend on the particular dish. Interestingly, I can do capers (won't say they're my fave thing in the world) but can't stand olives. I know a lot of people who are like the opposite as well--love olives and can't do capers. I used capers in a panzanella today (Italian bread salad) instead of Kalamata olives. I think the proportions are what get to me; it called for 1/2 c. of olives and I was fairly certain that that would have been overkill with capers.
Capers Substitute. Substitute For Capers. I won't swear by this as a substitute, but anchovies are processed much like capers. Capers are actually tiny immature buds of a bush found in the Middle East. They're pretty flavorless on their own, but the taste intensifies after sun-drying and brining. Anchovies are also sun-dried and brined, so you might be able to duplicate the taste of capers with a few chopped pieces.

The nervous system has many types of sensory neurons. Nerve endings on one end of each neuron are encased in a special structure to sense a specific stimulus. 1  Chemoreceptors sense chemicals. 2  The olfactory bulb that monitors your sense of smell has chemoreceptors that sense odors (chemicals in the air).
1 Sensory neurons carry signals from the outer parts of your body (periphery) into the central nervous system. 2  Motor neurons (motoneurons) carry signals from the central nervous system to the outer parts (muscles, skin, glands) of your body. 3  Interneurons connect various neurons within the brain and spinal cord.
Making the world better, one answer at a time. Sensory neurons are nerves that take in information from either the outside world, or from within the body itself. Sensory neurons communicate this information to the brain which then issues a response.
Sensory (afferent) neurons send the feeling of sticky wetness up your spinal cord to your brain. The sensory neurons pass the information off to the interneurons. The interneurons hanging out in the brain decide what to do. They then tell the motor (efferent) neurons the plan.
So as to understand the sensory neurons better, it is necessary to know its core make up. Neurons are considered as highly specialized cells that conduct electrochemical impulses termed as action potentials or nerve impulses.
The nervous system has many types of sensory neurons. Nerve endings on one end of each neuron are encased in a special structure to sense a specific stimulus. 1  Chemoreceptors sense chemicals.
Typically, a stimulus causes ionic changes in the receptor neuron's dendrites, which lead to the formation of action potentials in the receptor neurons. These action potentials travel the sensory neuron, which connects to a motor neuron (and possibly an ascending neuron) in the spinal cord.
A sensory neuron is a nervous system cell that is involved in the transportation of sensory neural impulses from receptors or sensory organs throughout the body. These neural impulses are sent to the brain and translated into an understandable form so that the organism can react to the stimuli.
Interneurons, or associative neurons, carry information between motor and sensory neurons. These fundamental members of the nervous system also vary with respect to their functions. 1  Sensory neurons carry signals from the outer parts of your body (periphery) into the central nervous system.
The main difference is that a sensory neuron carries messages in the form of electric impulse from sense organs to brain, whereas motor neurons carries messages to effect … ive organs. 9 people found this useful.
Mountain Lion Tracks and Sign Includes photos of tracks, scat, marking and feeding signs Home | About Us | How to Participate | Biodiversity Modules | Projects | Maps | News | Resources. Where they live: Other than humans, cougars are the most widely distributed land mammal in the Western Hemisphere.
While the Arizona lion episode was missing a dead lion in the end, the show still inspired some spirited online discussions about the merits of lion meat. As it happens, I include several pages on that subject in my forthcoming book, Meat Eater: Adventures from the Life of an American Hunter.
Species Code: FECO. Cougars, also known as mountain lions or pumas, are native to Washington state. About 2,500 live in Washington state, double the populations of the early 1980s, and their numbers are growing. What they look like: Cougars are carnivores (meat eating animals). They are very good at hiding and are rarely seen in the wild.
In fact, I’m pretty sure you could do a double-blind taste test between the loins of a mountain lion and a wild boar and you’d stump ninety percent of the participants. The legs are a slightly different story. I came into four of them once, off a Wyoming tom that was given to an ex-girlfriend of mine.
The most common prey are zebras, giraffes, pigs, cape buffalo, antelope, and wildebeests. And, of course, they're happy to eat human beings as well. Most prefer their humans with catsup, mustard, pickles, lettuce and a little mayo on a sesame bun.
More than half of California is mountain lion habitat. Mountain lions generally exist wherever deer are found. They are solitary and elusive, and their nature is to avoid humans. Mountain lions prefer deer but, if allowed, they also eat pets and livestock. In extremely rare cases, even people have fallen prey to mountain lions. Mountain lions that threaten people are immediately killed.
What they eat: Cougars hunt primarily from dusk till dawn (sunset to sunrise). Their primary prey is deer, but they also eat porcupines, raccoons, birds, small mammals, foxes, mice, and grass.
Related articles: Male lions usually leave almost all of the hunting to the females, but once a kill is made, they will sometimes drive off the females and cubs in order to be the first to feed upon the prey. Usually, several lionesses, working as a team, spread out and approach a herd from different directions.
It seems appropriate to paraphrase a few of those passages here, in order to weigh in on things. My experience with lion meat is relegated to animals from the northern Rockies, though I doubt it matters much, because lions eat what lions eat no matter where they live: red meat, primarily from deer. The loins are like wild boar, in both texture and flavor.
A lion skull. Teeth of a lion. The incisors of a lion (left), which are long, sharp and slightly recurved, are excellent tools for grasping and wounding prey, while the sharp premolars are effective in tearing away chunks of flesh. The molars are rudimentary because their food is swallowed in chunks, unchewed.
The most common and productive type of diamond mining, pipe mining, is a type of open-pit mining; therefore it involves similar techniques and environmental stresses as other types of open pit mining, in which large amounts of rock and materials, called overburden, are removed to allow access to the diamonds.n addition, diamond mining faces challenges relating to energy use and emissions which can contribute to the global climate change. In certain parts of Sierra Leone and other diamond-rich west African regions, there is little infrastructure in place to enforce whatever environmental regulations may exist.
Diamonds are also mined alluvially over disperse areas, where diamonds have been eroded out of the ground, deposited, and concentrated by water or weather action. There is also at least one example of a heritage diamond mine (Crater of Diamonds State Park).iamonds are also mined alluvially over disperse areas, where diamonds have been eroded out of the ground, deposited, and concentrated by water or weather action.

But damage to the environment is not the inevitable result of diamond mining – there are ways to mitigate the effects.esponsible Diamond Mining. Diamond mining is generally less harmful to the environment than other types of mining, such as gold mining, because it does not make use of toxic chemicals.

When home sales slow, good comps age fast. Add foreclosures and short sales to the mix and appraisals can run all over the map. The Home Valuation Code of Conduct, or HVCC, that went into effect last May has compounded the problem. The HVCC prohibits Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac lenders from having direct contact with appraisers.
Naturally, if the VA appraiser does find something that doesn’t look right or is in violation of the VA MPRs, that issue is noted for the appraisal report. However, the VA appraiser is primarily interested in insuring the home lives up to the criteria listed as well as other requirements issued by the VA.
Zero Value: There is no such thing in the FHA world for a certain feature or structure on a property to be given “zero value”. For example, despite a buyer, seller and agents agreeing that the run-down garage is not included in the sale, that’s not the way the appraiser will look at it.
When viewing the attic, appraisers make sure there are vents, no damage, no exposed or frayed wires, and that sunlight is not beaming through. When inspecting the crawl space, appraisers make sure there are no signs of standing water or any other foundation support issues.
The house was built in 2005, comps in the area were selling for about $10,000 less than the asking price. The seller counter-offered $9,000 less than the asking price, because of a moving date factor. The only thing I really saw that would be in question, would be some of the walls in the home.
What does an FHA appraiser look for? 10 Things You Might Not Know About FHA Appraisal Guidelines 1. Open up that Attic: If there is an attic, the appraiser is required to do a “head and shoulders” inspection of the attic – even if the attic access has been sealed off by the home owner.
That's especially true with Federal Housing Administration or Veterans Affairs deals; in such instances, a file number is assigned to the appraisal, Moss says. So, the next buyer has to look up that file number, he says. They can't just put that appraisal in a drawer.
Borrowers or sellers concerned about the nature of the property in question should hire a qualified inspector to perform more extensive reviews of the home for a detailed report on the condition of it in regards to heating, air conditioning, plumbing, etc.
Even when both sides agree on a price, the deal could fall apart thanks to an under-appraisal. Here's the increasingly common scenario: The seller lists the house for $325,000, the buyer offers $275,000 and they settle on a $300,000 sales price. A week before closing, the appraisal comes in at $265,000, the maximum upon which the bank or mortgage company is willing to lend.
It’s important to remember that a VA appraisal is not an inspection. Some appraisers include language in the comments section of the appraisal form that indicates the nature of the work done to determine fair market value on the property.
How fast can the human heart beat is a fascinating topic full of interesting facts. The human heart generally beats 60 to 80 times a minute, though anywhere between 60 and 100 beats per minute is considered normal, according to the Heart Rhythm Society. The heart beat increases during exercise, up to 160 to 180 beats per minute.
Heart rates of more than 100 beats per minute (tachycardia) can be caused by: 1  Exercise or stress. 2  Illnesses that cause fever. 3  Dehydration. 4  Medicine side effects, especially asthma medicines. 5  Heavy smoking, alcohol, or too much caffeine or other stimulants, such as diet pills. 6  Cocaine, amphetamines, and methamphetamines.
Adults. Healthy adults have a heart rate of between 60 and 90 or 100 beats per minute, depending on the expert source. People who exercise regularly have a resting heart rate closer to the lowest end of the scale. A number of factors can cause your heart rate to be at the top of the scale.
A normal heart rate for a healthy adult is between 60 and 100 beats per minute. Heart rates of more than 100 beats per minute (tachycardia) can be caused by: 1  Exercise or stress. 2  This fast heart rate usually returns to normal range (60 to 100 beats per minute) with rest and relaxation. 3  Illnesses that cause fever.
The most common heart rhythm problem for young people is supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), which is due to an abnormal wiring in a child’s heart. When children who play sports experience SVT, they should stop their activity until the episode terminates.
1 More than 2 million people in the U.S. have atrial fibrillation. 2  In. , 3  the heartbeat is irregular and rapid due to disorganized signals from the heart’s electrical system. 4  The upper chamber of the heart may beat as often as 300 times a minute, about four times faster than normal.
1 If a heartbeat is fast but also irregular, it is diagnosed as atrial fibrillation which is the most common type of heart rhythm disorder in the US, according to the Heart Rhythm Society. 2  How fast the human heart can beat depends on age. 3  The heart generally beats faster in children than adults.
0 Comments. When a child complains of a racing or irregular heartbeat, a parent’s concern is understandable. A fast heart rate in children in most situations is a normal response to increased levels of activity or, occasionally, anxiety. However, at times this could be a sign of a heart rhythm disorder that requires medical attention. We see two types of irregular heartbeats in children. An irregular heartbeat due to premature beats is fairly common, but on occasion can be a sign of more significant disease or of poor heart function.
A healthy heartbeat is not the same in everybody. The speed of your heartbeat depends on a number of factors. Even if you are in good health, you also need to take into consideration your physical condition. A person who exercises regularly has a different heart rate than somebody sedentary of the same age and weight.

Financially it just doesn’t make sense to spend that much money on your headshots every year– it’s not a good investment. That’s why many photographers, especially in Los Angeles, fall in between the two extremes. I currently charge $400 for a longer shoot and $200 for a shorter shoot, if you just need a few looks.

What is Headshot Photography? A headshot is a photograph of a person’s head and shoulders, with an emphasis on the person’s face. Some headshots – called three-quarter shots – include as much as ¾ of the person’s body. Actors and models most frequently need headshots.
Pricing for headshots varies considerably based upon location, the options you specify, the number of photos you require, and the experience of the photographer. If you need a number of different shots, wardrobe changes, or need to hire a stylist or make-up artist, the price will go up with each addition.
Exponents are supported on variables using the ^ (caret) symbol. For example, to express x 2, enter x^2. Note: exponents must be positive integers, no negatives, decimals, or variables. Exponents may not currently be placed on numbers, brackets, or parentheses.
Solving an Equation An equation is a mathematical statement that has two expressions separated by an equal sign. The expression on the left side of the equal sign has the same value as the expression on the right side. One or both of the expressions may contain variables. Solving an equation means manipulating the expressions and finding the value of the variables. An example might be:x = 4+8 to solve this equation we would add 4 and 8 and find that x = 12. Solving an Equation. An equation is a mathematical statement that has two expressions separated by an equal sign. The expression on the left side of the equal sign has the same value as the expression on the right side.
If your equation has an x 2 term or will have an x 2 term after multiplying out, it may be a quadratic, provided the other terms fit the form. Solving Quadratic Equations – Method 1 - Factoring The easiest way to solve a quadratic equation is to solve by factoring, if possible.
To get the variable by itself, we need to add 3 to both sides. Solve The variable in this equation is already on one side of the equation by itself. There is no need to add or subtract anything to both sides. However, the number in front of the variable is not 1.
When you enter an equation into the calculator, the calculator will begin by expanding (simplifying) the problem. Then it will attempt to solve the equation by using one or more of the following: addition, subtraction, division, taking the square root of each side, factoring, and completing the square.
For addition and subtraction, use the standard + and-symbols respectively. For multiplication, use the * symbol. A * symbol is not necessiary when multiplying a number by a variable. For instance: 2 * x can also be entered as 2x. Similarly, 2 * (x + 5) can also be entered as 2(x + 5); 2x * (5) can be entered as 2x(5). The * is also optional when multiplying with parentheses, example: (x + 1)(x - 1).

Thyroid Cancer Treatment Option Overview There are different types of treatment for patients with thyroid cancer. Different types of treatment are available for patients with thyroid cancer. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials.
There are several factors that may increase your risk of developing thyroid cancer. They include: Radiation exposure: Exposure to radiation in the head and neck during childhood may increase your risk of thyroid cancer.
Write down the details of your thyroid cancer, such as the type, stage and treatment options. Ask your doctor where you can go for more information. Good sources of information to get you started include the National Cancer Institute, the American Cancer Society and the American Thyroid Association.
Cancer of the thyroid is more common in women than in men. Most patients are between 25 and 65 years old. People who have been exposed to large amounts of radiation, or who have had radiation treatment for medical problems in the head and neck have a higher chance of getting thyroid cancer.
According to the National Cancer Institute, there are about 56,000 new cases of thyroid cancer in the US each year, and the majority of those diagnoses are papillary thyroid cancer—the most common type of thyroid cancer. Females are more likely to have thyroid cancer at a ratio of 3:1.
Surgery is the most common treatment for thyroid cancer. One of the following procedures may be used: Lobectomy: Removal of the lobe in which thyroid cancer is found. Lymph nodes near the cancer may also be removed and checked under a microscope for signs of cancer. Near-total thyroidectomy: Removal of all but a very small part of the thyroid.
Surgery is the most common treatment of cancer of the thyroid. 1  A doctor may remove the cancer using one of the following operations: 2  Lobectomy removes only the side of the thyroid where the cancer is found. Lymph nodes in the area may be taken out (biopsied) to see if they contain cancer.
For information about thyroid cancer and its treatment, see the topic Thyroid Cancer. Initial treatment When you know you have a thyroid nodule, your treatment options include:
Stage IV Papillary and Follicular Thyroid Cancer. Treatment of stage IV papillary and follicular thyroid cancer that has spread only to the lymph nodes can often be cured. When cancer has spread to other places in the body, such as the lungs and bone, treatment usually does not cure the cancer, but can relieve symptoms and improve the quality of life.
Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment. Five types of standard treatment are used:Surgery Surgery is the most common treatment of thyroid cancer. One of the following procedures may be used: Lobectomy: Removal of the lobe in which thyroid cancer is found.

Holly bush leaves can suffer from various diseases. The most common are Honey Dew Fungi, Tar Spot, Spine Spot, Bot Canker and Iron Chlorosis. Honey Dew Fungi grows in humid soil; this disease makes the leaves wilt and fall off. Toadstools will begin to form around the base of affected bushes.
Holly in good physi-. cal condition are rarely damaged. by this disease. The first noticeable symp-. toms of this disease are yellow-. ing and premature leaf drop of. the leaves on girdled limbs along. with a twig dieback. Cankers, often centered on a dead. twig, usually appear as slightly.
Spring Leaf Yellowing and Drop on Holly. Yellowing and dropping of holly leaves is usually from the interior of the plant. Some of our customers have called in late April with concerns about their holly shrubs or trees dropping leaves-sometimes quite a lot.
It sounds like your holly plants have been infected with a fungal disease known as holly leaf spot, sometimes called holly tar spot. It can be caused by several different fungi, but the symptoms are similar: the leaves develop black, brown, or yellow spots. Eventually, the infected leaves fall off the plant, leaving your holly bare and spindly. Leaf spot usually develops during wet spring weather, and the leaves begin dropping throughout the summer and fall.
Weather Damage. Large brown splotches on the leaves, especially around the edges, can be a sign that your holly plant has sustained weather damage, such as a sudden cold snap or a prolonged dry period. If rainfall drops below 1 inch per week, water your holly to ensure the roots are receiving enough moisture.
‘Carissa’ holly. 1  Watering: Water your hollies before noon, so that the leaves have a chance to dry off during the day. 2  Keep Plant Healthy: A strong plant can easily recover from leaf spot. See our article on How To Grow Hollies for tips on keeping your plants happy.
Smaller brown or yellow spots on the leaves may indicate that your holly plant has succumbed to tar spot or another fungal disease. Fungal infections are most likely to strike in the damp spring season, though they may appear at any time of year. If left untreated, the spots will spread and darken until they turn black.
Yellowing and dropping of holly leaves is usually from the interior of the plant. 1  Some of our customers have called in late April with concerns about their holly shrubs or trees dropping leaves-sometimes quite a lot.
Holly Leaf Spot Symptoms. The symptoms of this holly disease are easy to see. Most types of holly plants will first show black, yellow or brownish spots on the leaves. Eventually, the leaves will start to fall off the bush. Typically, the holly leaves will start to fall off the bottom of the plant and work its way up the plant. Leaves will normally fall off the plant in the spring, but the spots will first appear in the late fall or winter.
This ornamental bush can become infected with various diseases like any other type of ornamental plant. One of the most susceptible parts of the holly bush are the leaves. There are five common holly bush leaf diseases which can strike during different times of the year.
The question relates to those chicks that have fledged, and at what age they should be removed from their parents. My reply is always when they are ready.. Canary chicks usually fledge at anything from 17-24 days. Much will depend upon how well they have been fed, and on how many chicks there are in each nest.I find that broods of three, four or five chicks tend to fledge much earlier than if there is only a single or couple of chicks in the nest.any books suggest you remove the chicks at 21 days of age. My advice is to simply allow the birds to tell you when they are ready, which is when you see them eating soft food for themselves, at every new feed.
The baby canary does go through a behavior change when they reach 14 days old. They become wary of movements and noise in their surroundings. The flight instinct takes over when they feel threatened and will feel the need to escape to safety.oung canaries sometimes have infertile eggs, or do a poor job of feeding the young, or they may abandon the nestlings entirely. To help them to be successful it is advantageous to mate a young male with a mature hen or a young hen with a mature male.
If necessary, I have delayed moving chicks until they are four weeks of age, although this is certainly an exception. Most are fine by the time they are 23 or 24 days old, and many sooner, particularly in the height of summer.any books suggest you remove the chicks at 21 days of age. My advice is to simply allow the birds to tell you when they are ready, which is when you see them eating soft food for themselves, at every new feed.
Most baby canaries are parent-raised, resulting in birds that have imprinted onto their parents rather than a human hand-feeder. Barb Theeke, a bird breeder in Michigan, has hand-raised a few canaries over the years and found that, as with most hand-fed birds, they do become imprinted on humans.ost baby canaries are parent-raised, resulting in birds that have imprinted onto their parents rather than a human hand-feeder.

You may need to remove and raise a baby bird yourself if its parents are plucking the baby bird's feathers. Q: My cockatiels are picking at their babies’ developing feathers. In every other way they are wonderful parents.I am not sure what to do.ut anyway, when you have delinquent or abusive bird parents like this, the baby birds need to be temporarily taken away. The parent birds should then be forced to take parenting classes and prove they are good parents then they can get their kids back. I had a bird once that was a bad parent.

Too young or too old is not a good idea and the male and female should be chosen to breed only if they are in top condition. Having said that, I have an eight year old red factor cock that has filled two clutches already this year 2012. Also hens of just over eight months who have reared very good chicks.t what age can the canaries become independent? The age that a baby canary can survive without its parents is typically 31 days. Will the baby fledglings be able to learn to eat from the normal food dishes? The fledglings need low profile small food dishes to learn how to eat on their own at the bottom of the cage.
2. Many canary breeders will recommend that you use a specific blend of canary seed specially mixed for soaking and feeding to your baby canaries. This soak seed is soaked in water, rinsed, soaked again, rinsed a few more times over a 24 to 72 hour period...then it will begin to sprout.ust boil your canary’s normal seed for 20 minutes, let cool and place a tablespoon of this soft seed in the cage in the morning and another tablespoon in the afternoon along with the boiled egg. This soft seed will be used by both parents to feed the canary babies for the next 3 to 4 weeks.

The Sardonyx is a gemstone that has been prized for its beauty and rumored metaphysical properties for thousands of years. Its name is derived from the Greek words sard, meaning a reddish brown, and onyx, meaning veined gem. Sardonyx stone is a variation of onyx, which is a semiprecious stone of the silica mineral agate comprised of the chemical make-up SiO2.
Fortunately, many vegetables, such as broccoli and bok choy, which are high in iron, are also high in vitamin C so that the iron in these foods is very well absorbed.Commonly eaten combinations, such as beans and tomato sauce or stir-fried tofu and broccoli, also result in generous levels of iron absorption.ortunately, many vegetables, such as broccoli and bok choy, which are high in iron, are also high in vitamin C so that the iron in these foods is very well absorbed.
When you eat heme iron with other sources of non-heme iron, the iron is more completely absorbed. Foods high in vitamin C, like tomatoes, citrus fruits and red, yellow and orange peppers can also help with the absorption of non-heme iron.ood has two types of iron — heme iron and non-heme iron.

Iron in plant foods such as lentils, beans, and spinach is nonheme iron. This is the form of iron added to iron-enriched and iron-fortified foods.Our bodies are less efficient at absorbing nonheme iron, but most dietary iron is nonheme iron.1  1.ron-Rich Foods. Very good sources of heme iron, with 3.5 milligrams or more per serving, include: 1  3 ounces of beef or chicken liver. 2  3 ounces of clams, mollusks, or mussels. 3  3 ounces of oysters.
What foods are high in iron? The iron in food comes from two sources: animals and plants. Iron from animal sources is known as heme iron and is found in various meats and fish. Iron from plants is known as nonheme iron, and is found in certain vegetables and in iron-fortified foods such as breakfast cereals.Heme iron is better absorbed by the body than nonheme iron.The following foods are good sources of heme iron (from animal sources): 1  Chicken liver. 2  Oysters.3  Clams. 4  Beef liver.ron from plants is known as nonheme iron, and is found in certain vegetables and in iron-fortified foods such as breakfast cereals.

Iron is found in food in two forms, heme and non-heme iron. Heme iron, which makes up 40 percent of the iron in meat, poultry, and fish, is well absorbed. Non-heme iron, 60 percent of the iron in animal tissue and all the iron in plants (fruits, vegetables, grains, nuts) is less well absorbed.Because vegan diets only contain non-heme iron, vegans should be especially aware of foods that are high in iron and techniques that can promote iron absorption.ortunately, many vegetables, such as broccoli and bok choy, which are high in iron, are also high in vitamin C so that the iron in these foods is very well absorbed.

From the beginning of the 13th century, there is a rigidly fixed norm, often called Classical Modern Irish, which, for over four centuries, was used as the exclusive literary medium in Ireland and in Gaelic-speaking Scotland (there is no evidence for the Isle of Man).
People who live here are called Scottish, and some speak languages called Scottish Gaelic, a Celtic language, or Scots, which is a lot like English but is different from it. Wales is to the west of England. Its people are called Welsh and have their own Celtic language which is also called Welsh.
A 2010 Scottish Government study of public attitudes towards the Scots language found that 64% of respondents (around 1,000 individuals being a representative sample of Scotland's adult population) don't really think of Scots as a language, but it also found that the most frequent speakers are least likely to agree that it is not a language (58%) and those never speaking Scots most likely to do so (72%).
Anglian (Anglish) The Lowland Scots language is the direct descendant of the Anglian (or Anglish) language spoken there, with a distinct history and identity to the modern times, accounting for the difference between the Scots language and the English language.

Scottish English resulted from language contact between Scots and the Standard English of England after the 17th century. The resulting shifts to English usage by Scots-speakers resulted in many phonological compromises and lexical transfers, often mistaken for mergers by linguists unfamiliar with the history of Scottish English.

Scottish Gaelic was introduced from Ireland by raiders during the 4th and 5th centuries. Scottish Gaelic is mostly spoken in the Scottish Highlands. It is not to be confused with Scots which is a language/dialect spoken in the Scottish lowlands of Germanic origin and not a Celtic language. Scottish Gaelic has a rich oral and written tradition. While the number of speakers had been falling for a number of years, there is a growing number of young people speaking the language.
The Salos have dedicated their lives to providing a true history of traveling life in America and to dispelling the myths that are currently being spread on the web and other media.

If you have rust on the bottom door seams, it is coming from the inside.. There are drain holes on the bottom of the door. There is one near the door hinge, and another one on the outside of the door. Dirt buiding up along the seam inside the door can prevent water from flowing out to the drain holes.This trapped water can cause rust. What I do is run to the car wash and put the pressure washer on the outside drain hole until water begins to flow out the drain hole by the door hinge.When the water flows through, you've washed out any dirt/clay/gunk that may be obstructing water drainage.hen you can start on the body work. Bondo or fiberglass if it turned out to be a hole, spot putty and primer if it was just pits. (actually, rust is always the pits). Take your time, do a thorough job, or you will be doing it again soon.

The reimbursement is always income. The question is whether or not the purchase is an expense. If the purchase is an expense, then. The reimbursement is income which is offset by the purchase and the net on your taxes is $0. If the purchase is not an expense, then. The reimbursement is income and you pay taxes on it.
Maximizing Reimbursement-Related Tax Benefits. To maximize the tax benefits related to employee expense reimbursement, companies may set up an accountable plan. Expenses detailed and reimbursed under this plan are not considered taxable income to employees and therefore not subjected to payroll tax.
California law requires that mileage reimbursement be paid no matter what the persons wages are. A recent court decision allows mileage reimbursement be paid as wages, but it also must be annotated on pay records what portion of those wages are for reimbursement.
Cincinnati, OH | February 20, 2013 7:51pm. This is part of my pay is mileage reimbursement. wondered if i deduct this from my salary.
The reimbursement for business mileage must not exceed the current rate for the actual miles used to qualify for tax-free treatment. It is not critical whether business mileage is documented in a monthly expense report or an actual mileage log. The IRS allows a lot of leeway on the type or nature of the report.
Based on the current business mileage rate, the church reimburses him $598, less the $500 advance, or $98. Since the $598 advance and reimbursement represents reimbursement for church-related miles, there is no tax reporting required by the church for April regarding the automobile advance and reimbursement.
Reimbursing Business Expenses. Any business expense should be substantiated to qualify for reimbursement. In the case of mileage, a travel log prepared by the employee is acceptable. For ease of tracking, you can ask employees to use a mobile app to input all business-related expenses for reimbursement.
Many clergy receive an auto allowance. Others are reimbursed for their church-related mileage. While the reimbursement approach is nearly always the most tax advantageous to clergy, it comes with a price—the price is recordkeeping! Let's look at allowances first.
Re: Mileage reimbursement is NOT income!. There is no requirement in Federal law to pay for mileage reimbursement. What IS required is that workers make at least minimum wage. If any business expenses cause the employees net wage to go below minimum wage, then it violates federal minimum wage laws.
My argument would be NO. Mileage reimbursement is compensation for ware and tear on your vehicle and gas costs, hence it is not income. Opposing counsel will likely argue that your spouse has to drive to and from work, and does not get compensated for that gas mileage, and ware and tear, so it is income.

Definition. A low hemoglobin count is a commonly seen blood test result. Hemoglobin (Hb or Hgb) is a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen throughout the body.In many cases, a low hemoglobin count is only slightly lower than normal and doesn't affect how you feel.f it gets more severe and causes symptoms, your low hemoglobin count may indicate you have anemia. A low hemoglobin count is generally defined as less than 13.5 grams of hemoglobin per deciliter (135 grams per liter) of blood for men and less than 12 grams per deciliter (120 grams per liter) for women.
Hemoglobin (/ˈhiːmɵˌɡloʊbɨn/); also spelled haemoglobin and abbreviated Hb or Hgb, is the iron-containing oxygen-transport metalloprotein in the red blood cells of all vertebrates (with the exception of the fish family Channichthyidae) as well as the tissues of some invertebrates.emoglobin (/ˈhiːmɵˌɡloʊbɨn/); also spelled haemoglobin and abbreviated Hb or Hgb, is the iron-containing oxygen-transport metalloprotein in the red blood cells of all vertebrates (with the exception of the fish family Channichthyidae) as well as the tissues of some invertebrates.
A low hemoglobin level is referred to as anemia or low red blood count. Lower than normal number of red blood cells is referred to as anemia and hemoglobin level reflects this number. There are many reasons (causes) for anemia.Some of the more common causes of anemia are: 1  loss of blood (traumatic injury, surgery, bleeding, colon cancer or stomach ulcer),ower than normal number of red blood cells is referred to as anemia and hemoglobin level reflects this number. There are many reasons (causes) for anemia. Some of the more common causes of anemia are: 1  loss of blood (traumatic injury, surgery, bleeding, colon cancer or stomach ulcer),
The hemoglobin test is often used to check for anemia, usually along with a hematocrit or as part of a complete blood count (CBC) . The test may be used to screen for, diagnose, or monitor a number of conditions and diseases that affect red blood cells (RBCs) and/or the amount of hemoglobin in blood.igh hemoglobin with a high RBC count and high hematocrit indicates polycythemia. Some causes include: 1  Lung (pulmonary) disease —if someone is unable to breathe in and absorb sufficient oxygen, the body tries to compensate by producing more red blood cells.
Hemoglobin is the protein molecule in red blood cells that carries oxygen from the lungs to the body's tissues and returns carbon dioxide from the tissues back to the lungs.Hemoglobin is made up of four protein molecules (globulin chains) that are connected together.mbedded within the heme molecule is iron that is vital in transporting oxygen and carbon dioxide in our blood. The iron contained in hemoglobin is also responsible for the red color of blood. Hemoglobin also plays an important role in maintaining the shape of the red blood cells.
This is a blood test to find out how much hemoglobin is in your blood. Hemoglobin is the main part of your red blood cells. Hemoglobin is made up of a protein called globin and a compound called heme. Heme consists of iron and a pigment called porphyrin, which gives your blood its red color.Hemoglobin serves the important role of carrying oxygen and carbon dioxide through your blood.nemia can be caused by blood loss, decreased production of red blood cells, or increased destruction of red blood cells. Your healthcare provider can use your hemoglobin test to help find the cause of your anemia. These are other reasons you may need this test: To diagnose a disease that causes anemia.
Each globulin chain contains an important central structure called the heme molecule. Embedded within the heme molecule is iron that is vital in transporting oxygen and carbon dioxide in our blood.

Low hemoglobin means that a person's hemoglobin level when measured, is below the lowest limits of normal for their age and sex (see above normal range of values). For example, a 19 year old male would have low hemoglobin if the detected blood value was below 13.6 g/dl.nother term frequently used in place of low hemoglobin is anemia, or the person is described as being anemic. Some of the more common causes of anemia are as follows: 1  Nutritional (iron, folic acid, or vitamin B 12 deficiency [ pernicious anemia 2  ]). Gastrointestinal blood loss (ulcers, colon cancer). 3  Kidney problems.
Hemoglobin is the main part of your red blood cells. It carries oxygen through your blood. If your hemoglobin level is too low, you may not be able to supply the cells in your body with the oxygen they need to survive.Hemoglobin S (Hgb S) is an abnormal type of hemoglobin that you can inherit from your parents.Hgb S causes red blood cells to become stiff and abnormally shaped.Instead of having a normal round, disk shape, these red blood cells become sickle-shaped, or crescent-shaped. These cells don't live as long as normal red blood cells.f your hemoglobin level is too low, you may not be able to supply the cells in your body with the oxygen they need to survive. Hemoglobin S (Hgb S) is an abnormal type of hemoglobin that you can inherit from your parents. Hgb S causes red blood cells to become stiff and abnormally shaped.
A low hemoglobin count can be associated with a disease or condition that causes your body to have too few red blood cells. This can occur if: 1  Your body produces fewer red blood cells than usual. 2  Your body destroys red blood cells faster than they can be produced. low hemoglobin count can also be due to blood loss, which can occur because of: 1  Bleeding from a wound. 2  Bleeding in your digestive tract, such as from ulcers, cancers or hemorrhoids.

There is strong evidence that the Milankovitch cycles affect the occurrence of glacial and interglacial periods within an ice age. The present ice age is the most studied and best understood, particularly the last 400,000 years, since this is the period covered by ice cores that record atmospheric composition and proxies for temperature and ice volume.

John Francis Kelly (born May 11, 1950) is the fifth and current United States Secretary of Homeland Security. He is a retired United States Marine Corps general and the former commander of United States Southern Command, the Unified Combatant Command responsible for American military operations in Central America, South America and the Caribbean.
President-elect Donald Trump is nominating retired Marine Gen. John F. Kelly for secretary of homeland security. Here's what you need to know about him. (Sarah Parnass,Osman Malik/The Washington Post) By Jerry Markon and Dan Lamothe By Jerry Markon and Dan Lamothe December 7, 2016.
Donald Trump Picks John Kelly, Retired General, to Lead Homeland Security. Gen. John F. Kelly left the Trump National Golf Club after a meeting with the president-elect in Bedminster, N.J., last month.
President-elect Donald Trump has chosen retired Marine Gen. John F. Kelly to run the Department of Homeland Security, turning to a blunt-spoken border-security hawk who clashed with the Obama administration over women in combat and plans to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay, according to people familiar with the decision.
Kelly was the senior military assistant to the Secretary of Defense and personally greeted Secretary Panetta at the entrance to the Pentagon on July 1, 2011, Panetta's first day as secretary. Kelly succeeded General Douglas M. Fraser as commander of U.S. Southern Command on November 19, 2012.
Trump taps Kelly for Homeland Security, third general for top post. NEW YORK/WASHINGTON President-elect Donald Trump plans to nominate a third retired general for a top job in his new administration with the choice of a battle-hardened Marine commander to lead the agency set up after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks to protect the U.S. homeland.
Kelly previously served as the commanding general of the Multi-National Force—West in Iraq from February 2008 to February 2009, and as the commander of Marine Forces Reserve and Marine Forces North in October 2009. Kelly succeeded General Douglas M. Fraser as commander of U.S. Southern Command on November 19, 2012.
Another one joins Trump's team of Generals: Marine veteran John Kelly - the highest ranking military officer to have lost a child in combat - will lead Homeland Security. President-elect Donald Trump plans to nominate retired Marine General John Kelly to lead the Department of Homeland Security, CBS News reported on Wednesday. Kelly, the former head of the U.S. Southern Command, has accepted the offer, CBS said, citing unidentified sources.
Kelly, 66, will be second general in cabinet and is third to be named to Trump team. He joins Defense Secretary pick, retired Marine General James 'Mad Dog' Mattis and national security adviser-designate, Army Lieutenant General Michael Flynn.
Trump is expected to name former Marine General John Kelly, 66, as head of the Department of Homeland Security, a source familiar with the decision told Reuters on Wednesday.
How to Tell a Piebald. The piebald gene is recessive, meaning you could find a piebald puppy in a litter produced by two nonpiebald parents. A piebald's markings are always perfectly mirrored from one side of its body to another. If a white dachshund has spotting over one eye, one or more blue eyes or random markings on its body, it is a double dapple, which is a variation of the merle pattern.
A piebald dachshund puppy is born when two wieners with the recessive piebald gene breed together. Dachshund coat colors and patterns are determined by so-called dominant and recessive genes in the dog's parents. Notably, this does not mean that the parents both have to be piebald dachshunds.
With their short, stubby legs and extra-long bodies, dachshunds are sometimes referred to as wiener dogs or sausage dogs. The dogs come in a variety of colors besides the common reddish-brown. Brindles, merles, black-and-tans and dappled are just a few of the pattern variations you might see in the show ring. The piebald -- a primarily white dachshund with symmetrical dark markings -- is less desirable in the show ring but has all the qualities that make a dog of this breed a desirable pet.
Dapple Dachshund coat patterns. stands out from the others. The Dapple dachshund really stands out from the crowd, no one is exactly the same as the other, some people just love the dapple doxie and just have to have one. They are one of several patterns that appear in this breed such as piebald, double dapple, brindle... there are also a variety of coat colors, that's the great thing about the dachshund there is such a choose. What is a Dapple Dachshund. Not the easiest pattern to describe, but I will give it a go.
The dapple coat in dachshunds is cause by a dominant gene and may not follow the coat color of mum or dad, but one parent must be a dapple to produce a dapple pup. Breeding from a lightly dappled can produce heavily dappled pups. To breed a puppy one of the parents must show the pattern.
Both parents must be dapple to produce a double dapple. SABLE - (can only appear in long hair) These terms (especially sable) are often mistakenly used to. refer to an interspersion of black hairs on back and neck over red color. A true sable/wildboar will. appear to be black/tan from a distance.
Several years ago the Dachshund Club of America took a vote and removed the term Piebald from the Dachshund Standard. (A breed standard is a detailed description of a breed compiled and maintained by the breeds parent organization.) The vote was kept pretty quiet and even then barely scraped by with one vote to win.
Your sausage dog is a piebald dachshund if it sports areas of full-color fur on a white background. You have probably seen the piebald pattern on other dogs that, like the dachshund, are part of the hound family. Basset hounds, beagles and greyhounds quite commonly display a piebald pattern. Dapple-pattern dachshunds are commonly confused with piebalds, but these are different types of coat pattern.
Piebald dachshunds are distinct from dappled dachshunds. Dachshunds are fun, loving dogs and can be a popular choice for apartment living. With any short, long or wiry hair, a dachshund can be black and tan, red or spotted.
The Piebald Dachshund is truly one of our greatest passions as a Dachshund Breeder here at Ponderosa Pups. Piebald Dachshunds have a pattern that is easily described as a Dachshund that has a base coloring of white. To someone that is not familiar with our breed, you may think this is a red and white dachshund (Red Piebald), or a black and white dachshund. (brown and white, cream and white, etc.) I’ve even heard them called Spotted Dachshunds. In many other breeds this would be called a “parti” or a “tri-color”.
Click to expand... As noted above I do not think you can, @EriCal -- it is a bummer for now. My car lacks TACC but I can see reasons to disable it (directing that comment @ecarfan) You'd wonder why to disable it-- and for the OP who is in SoCal I'd say prob not necessary. However, here in Ohio the problem often comes from weather.
Adaptive Cruse Control (Implemented) Now Implemented! Adaptive cruse control extends the standard cruse control to either follow a vehicle in front at a pre-set distance and/or slow down if a vehicle appear closer than a pre-set distance. The distance is typically speed related, such that the faster the speed the larger the safety distance.
Tesla Model S Crashes Into Back Of Van As Adaptive Cruise Control Fails To Stop Car – Video. Even if the car reacts correctly thousands of times on its own, there’s a chance that some situation will trip up the system, resulting in a crash as seen in the video above.
141 responses to Tesla Model S Crashes Into Back Of Van As Adaptive Cruise Control Fails To Stop Car – Video. 1  Driver is an idiot. 2  This is clearly the thing that Tesla write about in the instructions about the Autopilot. 3  At 04 seconds you can hear the warning sound for the driver.  The beta test continues.
What is likely is that that screen means that Tesla is at least considering adding adaptive cruise as an option in the future. If there is a camera in the front of the car they could add it. Mobileye has adaptive cruse control . I.e. if the windshield sensor was a camera vs a simple sensor.
Electric Cars. Drivers of the Tesla Model S are generally pretty happy with their cars, but as with any new product there are always a few ways it could be improved. Tesla Motors [NSDQ:TSLA] is one of few companies that can execute those improvements without you having to lift a finger, as software updates can be achieved via the internet.
The Model S had active cruise control engaged, yet it didn’t stop for the van on the shoulder as the Tesla’s sensors were instead locked on the car that veers right to avoid colliding with the van. Editor’s Note: The YT video by the Model S owner has now been taken off-line (perhaps due to legal/fault issues for the parties involved).
Whether lane departure warning, adaptive cruise control and blind spot detection will be software updates is a different matter, but all have been discovered deep within the car's menus by an enterprising owner (via Autoblog).
No real announcement. After 3 threads in one day about adaptive cruise and several threads about the interior in the past few days I have to wonder if there is more to these questions than what meets the eye. Speaking of eye. There was an announcement that Tesla would be working with Mobile Eye a long time ago.
I Drove A Car With 'Adaptive Cruise Control' And It Was Amazing. I test drive a lot of cars, but one feature I often overlook is cruise control. This is partly because I spent the last decade in Southern California, where freeway driving is often defined by low-speed, high-traffic, stop-and-go motoring.

The money involved in golf is overflowing, almost eclipsing the GDP of many small countries. Bowling has nowhere near that cache’ or capital, and bowling does not have a Tiger Woods to carry it into national prominence. Golf runs many local qualifiers, and then sectionsls, to qualify for the U.S. Open, and it works. As for bowling doing the same, not so much. The need for bowling centers nationwide to come together to support the BPAA and the U.S. Open by holding qualifiers would be paramount, and it would never happen.

Gamma is the same word as camel, in Semitic gimel. The letter actually does look like a camel's head. This letter passed into the Latin alphabet in this position in a curved form as our C. The Etruscans did not distinguish between the g and k sounds, so Greek gamma came to have the k sound in Latin.
The term is derived from the Greek letter sigma, a mathematical term that represents a measure of variation. According to Motorola, Six Sigma has had non-manufacturing applications in transactional processes, such as billing and customer support.
Everybody has heard of fraternities that require pledges to recite the Greek alphabet while a match burns down to their fingers. Lambda Chi Alpha chapters don't do stupid stuff like that. This unit is is fun-to-know, for Lambda Chi Alpha brothers or anybody else. The word alphabet itself comes from the first two letters of the Greek alphabet. The original Greek letter society, Phi Beta Kappa, took its initials from the motto Philosophy is the Helmsman of Life. Since then, campus secret societies have adopted letters which have similar cryptic meanings.
By custom, our fraternity pronounces it as the Romans would have pronounced the English transliteration. Classical Greek pronunciation follows spelling, except that tt is pronounced s, gg is pronounced ng, and gk is pronounced nk. R is trilled. Almost all Greek words have an accent mark.

Sigma Transliterated S Ancient Pronunciation: s as sense This came from the Semitic alphabet, where it was once shaped like our W. (The Hebrew shin, familiar to most people from Jewish religious objects, is the same letter.) The letter was turned to make the classical Greek sigma. The Greek sigma in turn was altered slightly as our s. At the end of a word, lower-case sigma was written as our lower-case s.
The basic idea behind Six Sigma is that if one can measure the amount of defects in a process, one can systematically determine how to eliminate them, getting as close to zero defects (i.e., perfection) as possible.

Large pituitary tumors — those measuring about 1 centimeter (slightly less than a half-inch) or larger — are known as macroadenomas. Smaller tumors are called microadenomas. Because of the size of macroadenomas, they can put pressure on the normal pituitary gland and nearby structures.
Alcohol has two noticeable effects on the hypothalamus and pituitary gland, which influence sexual behavior and urinary excretion. Alcohol depresses the nerve centers in the hypothalamus that control sexual arousal and performance. As BAC increases, sexual behavior increases, but sexual performance declines.
Alcohol inhibits the pituitary secretion of anti-diuretic hormone (ADH), which acts on the kidney to reabsorb water. Alcohol acts on the hypothalamus/pituitary to reduce the circulating levels of ADH. When ADH levels drop, the kidneys do not reabsorb as much water; consequently, the kidneys produce more urine.
Alcohol Abuse: •Alcoholism is a state of. continued excessive use of. alcohol and addiction to it. •Alcohol - quickly absorbed in the. stomach and upper part of the. small intestine and reaches. tissues in a few minutes.
Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), also known as thyrotropin, is produced by the pituitary gland in the brain and causes the thyroid to make thyroid hormone. When there is not enough thyroid hormone in the body, the pituitary makes more TSH, which tells the thyroid to make and release more thyroid hormone.
Why do people get thyroid nodules? A thyroid nodule is a growth within the thyroid gland, which may or may not be felt by physical exam.

Nicholas Sparks & his wife separate after 25 years of marriage. ‘Tis the season for beginning and ending celebrity marriages, apparently. This newest split arrives with much irony. Nicholas Sparks, the scribe known for such “romantic” tomes like Message in a Bottle and Safe Haven, announced that he and his wife of 25 years have separated.

The good: This food is very low in Saturated Fat, Cholesterol and Sodium. It is also a good source of Dietary Fiber, Vitamin C, Potassium and Manganese, and a very good source of Vitamin B6. The bad: A large portion of the calories in this food come from sugars.
Although folate is sometimes referred to as folic acid, there is a distinction between the two. Folate, the source explains, is the naturally occurring form of the vitamin that is found in plant and animal foods. While folic acid is the synthetic version of folate, which is found in supplements and fortified foods.
The main form of folate in plasma is 5-methyl-THF. Folic acid can also be found in the blood unaltered (known as unmetabolized folic acid), but whether this form has any biological activity or can be used as a biomarker of status is not known .
Bananas are a great source of potassium, but too much of a good thing can be dangerous. Too many bananas cause an excess of potassium, which can trigger hyperkalemia. This condition causes nausea, a slower pulse, and an irregular heartbeat. It can also trigger cardiac arrest.
Based on these values, the FNB defined DFE as follows: 1  1 mcg DFE = 1 mcg food folate. 2  1 mcg DFE = 0.6 mcg folic acid from fortified foods or dietary supplements consumed with foods. 3  1 mcg DFE = 0.5 mcg folic acid from dietary supplements taken on an empty stomach.
In Southeast Asia – the center of diversity for bananas, both wild and cultivated – the distinction between bananas and plantains does not work, according to Valmayor et al. Many bananas are used both raw and cooked. There are starchy cooking bananas which are smaller than those eaten raw.
Serving Size (1 medium banana), 23.6 micrograms of folic acid (6% DV), 105 calories. Tomato Juice If you struggle to meet your daily folic acid requirements, a serving of tomato juice is a great way to reach that last stretch.
Bananas contain useful amounts of these B vitamins, ranging from 785 micrograms of niacin to 24 micrograms of folate in one medium banana. Vitamin E Bananas also contain vitamin E, sometimes referred to as alpha-tocopherol.
Bananas were introduced to Africa by Arabian traders and discovered there in 1482 A.D. by Portuguese explorers who took them to the Americas, the place where the majority of bananas are now produced.
Bananas are a fascinating fruit in terms of their carbohydrate and sugar content. Even though bananas are a fruit that tastes quite sweet when ripe—containing 14-15 grams of total sugar—bananas receive a rating of low in their glycemic index (GI) value. GI measures the impact of a food on our blood sugar.

The nuclear arms race was a competition between the United States and the Soviet Union for nuclear weapons superiority lasting throughout the Cold War. The nuclear arms race began in earnest immediately after the United States successfully exploded two atomic bombs over Japan in 1945.n this lesson, we will examine the nuclear arms race between the United States and the Soviet Union that took place throughout the post-war era. We will learn why this arms race took place, and we will highlight key developments associated with it.

Even before the United States entered the War it feared that Nazi Germany was attempting to develop an atomic bomb.President Roosevelt therefore authorized an experimental nuclear weapons program – the Manhattan Project – in collaboration with Britain and Canada.ntroduction The nuclear arms race began during the Second World War. Even before the United States entered the War it feared that Nazi Germany was attempting to develop an atomic bomb.
A third major naval arms race, involving the United States, Britain, and Japan, erupted at the end of World War I. It was fueled by Japanese efforts to expand their political influence in East Asia and by an American attempt to gain greater political leverage over Britain.eads and lags in an arms race against a background of a hegemonic struggle characterized the Cold War as well, but the deterrent effect of weapons of mass destruction made “now or never” calculations much less tempting for the superpowers of the nuclear age.
The first nuclear weapon was created by the U.S. during the Second World War and was developed to be used against the Axis powers. Scientists of the Soviet Union were aware of the potential of nuclear weapons and had also been conducting research on the field.uring this period, in addition to the American and Soviet nuclear stockpiles, other countries developed nuclear weapons, though none engaged in warhead production on nearly the same scale as the two superpowers.
The Cold War, and with it the nuclear arms race, came to a rather abrupt end when the Soviet Union dissolved in 1991.

One easy and convenient alternative is protein powder. However, there are several types of protein powders on the market today. It is important to understand which supplements are safe to use during pregnancy.
Rather, the field pea is the new protein star. Field peas are grown for the purpose of drying, not to be eaten fresh, and can be either green or yellow. They are dried and often split and sold as split peas.. These same peas can be ground up, de-fatted, and then used as a powder. Pea protein is often combined with rice protein in products to make a complete protein. [See Why These Famous Vegetarians and Vegans Pass on Meat.].
“However, since it's plant-based, it's not a complete protein, so pair it with other plant-based proteins like hemp or pea powder to complete the essential amino acid profile,” says Brendan Brazier, formulator of Vega and author of Thrive.
If you are pregnant, getting enough protein in your diet is just part of the picture. You also want to make sure you are getting enough vitamins, minerals, and omega-3 fatty acids.
When you are pregnant, it’s important to make sure you’re fulfilling all the dietary needs for both you and your baby. During the 9 months of pregnancy, your nutrient requirements increase to support the rapid growth and development of your baby.
“Try adding a scoop to your oatmeal or making a smoothie with 100%-percent orange juice for a full day’s supply of vitamin C, tons of potassium, and B vitamins for a post-workout snack.”. When it comes to buying the right type, it's easy to be confused by the tons of different powders on store shelves.
And now pea protein and pea protein isolates are being used to replace eggs, soy and dairy in a range of products, including pasta, crackers, salad dressing, cereal, smoothies and even (shocker!) brownies. [See Best Diets for Healthy Eating.].
Lastly, although research is limited, most nutritive sweeteners, and a few non-nutritive sweeteners, have been deemed safe for consumption during pregnancy. However, be sure to stay away from products that contain the non-nutritive sweetener saccharin, as the safety of its use during pregnancy is still under question.
Again, since pea protein is plant-based, it isn’t a complete protein so it needs to be paired with other vegan sources of protein, like brown rice or hemp. RELATED: Whether or not you consume dairy, you'll love these thick, satisfying vegan smoothies. 6.
“Look for whey protein isolate—not concentrate—as it contains the highest protein concentration (90 to 95 percent) and very little fat.”. 2. Casein: Another milk protein, casein is absorbed by the body much more slowly than whey, says Heather Mangieri, R.D. , a spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.

Mr. Zyman and company test a new, sweeter version of the flagship cola with 190,000 nationwide taste tests at a cost of $4 million. At a bottlers' meeting in Atlanta back on April 22, 1985, Mr. Zyman announced from the stage that Coke was changing its taste.dvertising Age's coverage of New Coke from July 15, 1985. Still smarting from the 1975 Pepsi Challenge taste-test battle, Coca-Cola Co. launches Project Kansas, a top-secret mission to reformulate Coke.
However, the American public's reaction to the change was negative, even hostile, and the new cola was a major marketing failure. The subsequent reintroduction less than three months later of Coke's original formula, re-branded as Coca-Cola Classic, resulted in a significant gain in sales.n 1985, New Coke was sold only in Canada, the United States, and United States territories, while the original formula continued to be sold in the rest of the world (had the new version been a success it would presumably have been introduced worldwide).
Since the failure of new Coke, Mr. Goizueta said, the company's cola volume has risen 29 percent, the market capitalization of the company has grown to $75 billion from $9 billion and its share price has soared, closing at $58.50 on the New York Stock Exchange today.oca-Cola has never disclosed how much it lost in the new Coke fiasco, though bottlers told Mr. Meyers of Beverage Digest that they took a hit of $30 million on unwanted concentrate for new Coke. The company also spent $4 million on market testing and taste comparisons with 200,000 consumers.

New Coke originally had no separate name of its own, but was simply known as the new taste of Coca-Cola until 1992 when it was renamed Coca-Cola II.n 1985, New Coke was sold only in Canada, the United States, and United States territories, while the original formula continued to be sold in the rest of the world (had the new version been a success it would presumably have been introduced worldwide).
Think of a brand success story, and you may well think of Coca-Cola. Indeed, with nearly 1 billion Coca-Cola drinks sold every single day, it is the world’s most recognized brand. Yet in 1985 the Coca-Cola Company decided to terminate its most popular soft drink and replace it with a formula it would market as New Coke.t therefore decided to scrap the original Coca-Cola and introduced New Coke in its place. The trouble was that the Coca-Cola company had severely underestimated the power of its first brand. As soon as the decision was announced, a large percentage of the US population immediately decided to boycott the new product.
The difference in taste was a major reason for the failure of ‘New Coke’ among the masses, tests done by their research and development department proved that the taste of the Coke was the reason it was losing its market share.o make matters worse, Pepsi launched advertisements in New York Times and other publications stating that Pepsi had won the ‘cola war’ and has taken a lead due to the mistake made by Coca Cola. Coke did not react to this, as they were already pressurized by the consequences of the fiasco.
Yes, it infuriated the public, cost a ton of money and lasted only 77 days before we reintroduced Coca-Cola Classic. Still, New Coke was a success because it revitalized the brand and reattached the public to Coke.n 1985, New Coke was sold only in Canada, the United States, and United States territories, while the original formula continued to be sold in the rest of the world (had the new version been a success it would presumably have been introduced worldwide).

The new product continued to be sold and retained the name Coca-Cola (until 1992, when it was officially renamed Coca-Cola II), so the old product was named Coca-Cola Classic, also called Coke Classic, later just Coke and for a short period of time it was referred to by the public as Old Coke.n 1985, New Coke was sold only in Canada, the United States, and United States territories, while the original formula continued to be sold in the rest of the world (had the new version been a success it would presumably have been introduced worldwide).

Choose your grass. Take your time selecting a grass species. Lawn care will be much easier if the grass is suited to your climate, soil type, and use patterns. Research the specific species, not just cool season or warm season grass.erate your yard in fall or spring. Once a year, remove plugs of soil using a lawn aerator with ½ in (1.25 cm) diameter tines. Remove them to a depth of 3 inches (7.5cm), passing over the lawn until you have about 8 plugs per square foot (88 per square meter). This fights soil compaction, disease, and thatch buildup.

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. Savant syndrome is a condition in which a person with a mental disability, such as an autism spectrum disorder, demonstrates profound and prodigious capacities or abilities far in excess of what would be considered normal.his syndrome is rarer, with a study by Darold Treffert in 2010 showing that in a registry of 319 known savants, only 32 had acquired savant syndrome.

One theory on the cause of Savant Syndrome states that abstract thought is unable to function in a savant mind, or is severely limited. This lack of abstraction over-exercises the more concrete mind functions, and extraordinary talents may develop as a result.
Savant syndrome is a rare but spectacular condition in which persons with developmental disabilities, including but not limited to autism, or other central nervous system (CNS) disorders or disease have some spectacular “islands of genius” that stand in jarring juxtaposition to overall limitations.t is over 200 years ago since the first case of savant syndrome appeared in a scientific journal in Germany, and it is 125 years since Dr. J. Langdon Down first described savant syndrome as a distinct condition.
Children who display savant syndrome have traditionally been referred to as idiot, retarded, or autistic savants. The negative connotations of the term idiot have led to the disuse of idiot savant. Because the syndrome is often associated with autism, the term autistic savant is more frequently heard.pproximately 10 percent of all children with autism have savant syndrome. The rate increases to 25 percent of children with autism who have an IQ over 35. (Many autistic children have lower IQs.) About three times as many boys as girls have savant syndrome.

3 dead in explosion at industrial plant near Deridder. DERIDDER, La. (KLFY) - Three people are dead and several more injured after an explosion at a packaging plant in Beauregard Parish. Chief Deputy Joe Toler, of the parish sheriff’s office, says they were notified about 11:10 a.m. Wednesday about a blast at the Packaging Corporation of America facility and sent several units to investigate.
According to initial reports, the explosion took place while contractors performed welding on a tank during a facility shut down. The explosion was powerful enough to cause the tank to fly and land in a different area of the plant. Welding is one of several types of “hot work” – or spark-producing operations - that can ignite fires or explosions.

The rule of thumb is that if you can change out your clutch plates, you can install any of our Rekluse clutches. Detailed instructions are provided with each kit and we have installation videos on our website. Technical Support is available Monday-Friday from 8:30am-5:00pm Mountain Time.
Because the auto clutch eliminates stalling, which is usually the reason for adding a flywheel weight, most customers of a Rekluse clutch choose not to run one. The auto clutch allows you to ride gear tall with greater success, so for many, there is not a need for a flywheel weight once a Rekluse auto clutch is installed. Some choose to use both. >>
(Sorry for the T's, but it just worked out that way). Time - A clutch replacement job seems to take somewhere between 8-12 hours for the 'average' car owner. Shops, of course, can do it in much less time, but they have hydraulic lifts, power tools, and experience most of us just don't have.
If shifting without the clutch lever it is recommended to “Power Shift” just as you would a regular manual clutch. Even with a Rekluse clutch it can be tough to shift up through the gears if you are under power without chopping the throttle or bumping the clutch lever.
1 The clutch disc fits properly onto the splines of the transmission's input shaft. It has to fit without binding or jangling around. 2  The throw out bearing fits properly on the nose of the input shaft housing. Again it has to fit without binding or jangling around.

1 hint - My transmission did not weigh 100 lbs. 2  Hint - Getting the transmission back in place was a real pain for two reasons. 3  Hint - Once you start bolting up the tranny get the top two 17mm bolts snugged down before you move to the 14mm holding the clutch hose and wiring harness.
The clutch disc fits properly onto the splines of the transmission's input shaft. 1  It has to fit without binding or jangling around. Unless you are changing to a different clutch configuration, it must be the same size as the one being replaced. 2  The throw out bearing fits properly on the nose of the input shaft housing.
A clutch job, (new pressure plate, new clutch disc, new throw out bearing, and new pilot bearing) apparently costs somewhere between $500-$600. Replacement OEM parts cost about $170. (links off of Miata.net will get you a number of good suppliers). So if you do it yourself, you might save $300+.
Wildflower Uses. Many wildflowers are edible, used in medicines, or both. For example, the wildflower Foxglove is the plant a hybrid was bred from for the heart medicine digitalis. The Wild Plum is the tree that most hybrid commercial plum trees came from.
Royal Catchfly (Silene regia) This striking plant may grow as high as five feet, with bright red flowers. It flowers from May through September, and can be seen in remnant prairies and open woods. In Missouri, it is known only in the Ozarks.
Trees survive and grow best when planted under conditions similar to those where they occur naturally. Missouri is part of the great central hardwood forest region. More than 160 species of trees are found in the state. Trees preferring similar conditions form forest communities.

Economics in the Ozarks. The economy of the mid nineteenth century Ozarks resembled modern day Ozark livelihood in a lot of ways. The steady stream of people heading west found their fortunes, hardships, and legacies in the frontier of the rocky, river fed Missouri hills. Missouri’s population nearly doubled in every decade preceding the Civil War.
Desirable species typically found on the better sites include scarlet, northern red, shumard, black, and white oak. Shagbark hickory, white ash, blackgum, river birch, eastern redcedar and shortleaf pine are other common species. In the eastern Ozarks, cherrybark oak, sweetgum and tulip poplar are common.
Ozark Trees & More. It is impossible to imagine the Ozark hills without trees. Black walnut picking, hickory nut cake, butternut wood carvings, hedge fence posts, sassafras tea. Cedar trees for Christmas, catalpas alongside the railroads, pawpaw groves, persimmons turned sweet by the frost. And spring mountainsides, alive with dogwood and redbud.
Several dozen species of plants are endemic to the Ozarks, meaning they live nowhere else in the world. Plus, several globally rare plants, as will as many that are rare in Missouri, can be seen in the Ozarks. If you are just starting out, a good field guide, such as “Missouri Wildflowers,” is a must.
This guide helps answer these questions. If you are planning a large planting or a commercial planting, seek advice from a professional forester. Contact the MU Extension center in your county or the State Forester, Missouri Department of Conservation, Jefferson City.
Everyone likes wildflowers, and there is something for every wildflower enthusiast in the Ozarks. From the bloom of spring beauties in late winter, to the last goldenrods of November, there is always a floral display somewhere.

A feeling of cold without a physical 1  source. A sense of a rising or falling pitch without any audible sound.
Hugging in a dream can mean many things, depending on the context in which the hug occurs. An embrace is a symbolic gesture that can mean different things to different people, but there is an underlying feeling of interconnectedness that appears to be consistent. The meaning of being hugged in a dream changes based on whom you hug. Mothers who dream of hugging their children, for example, are signs of a positive, protective and trusting bond. It's not uncommon for a pregnant woman to dream of holding, hugging and loving the baby she is carrying.
You've learned to hold your hand over a stove burner to feel if there is heat energy coming off of it before you touch it and can feel it quite far away if you tune in to the feeling of “heat”. If you pay attention, you may even be able to feel light falling upon your skin.

Like the other lower levels of eye contact, the glance and a half is subtle and difficult to notice without a lot of practice. It’s when someone looks at you and breaks eye contact as they normally do, but they hold the eye contact for a split second longer than is normal. I’m talking maybe 1/4 of a second longer.
This is in fact what physicists have seen on the smallest level of matter, the Quantum level, where a particle can exist at many places at the same time yet still be only one “thing”. To notice these subtle energies, you have to know that Spiritual energy exists.
Beyond the lowest level of eye contact, this is when someone is not only not making eye contact with you, but they’re consciously making an effort to NOT look at you. In the heights of sexual intimacy, Level (-1) is subterranean.

A cervical disc displacement occurs when there is a herniation or protrusion between discs in the spine. The bones that form the spine, referred to as vertebrae, feature discs between each bone to protect and allow for flexible movement of the back.
The primary focus of rehabilitation for a cervical intervertebral disc displacement without myelopathy is to decrease symptoms and increase function. Although exercise may be uncomfortable initially, individuals must be instructed in the benefits of ongoing exercise in managing the symptoms.

Titanium dioxide, also known as titanium oxide or titania, is the naturally occurring oxide of titanium, chemical formula TiO 2. When used as a pigment, it is called titanium white, Pigment White 6, or CI 77891. Generally it is sourced from ilmenite, rutile and anatase. It has a wide range of applications, from paint to sunscreen to food coloring. When used as a food coloring, it has E number E171. World production in 2014 exceeded 9 million metric tons.
By David Fox Titanium dioxide Information about the compound: Works cited Chemical Name: titanium dioxide. Common Name: Anatase (one of the 3 mineral forms of titanium dioxide), the other two mineral forms are brookite and rutile. Chemical Formula: TiO2. Polar/Nonpolar: Polar.
Hydrous titanium dioxide is typically precipitated from aqueous titanium tetrachloride solution or from aqueous titanyl sulfate solution. Hydrous titania is believed to promote the adhesion of subsequent treatment to the base pigment. If present, this treatment is often the first layer applied to the surface.
Most particles were 1 to 2 microns in diameter and consisted of silicon and aluminum; a few particles consisted of iron and titanium. In the titanium dioxide exposed group, titanium dioxide particles were most commonly seen in interstitial macrophages of the alveolar walls, with occasional particle laden macrophages seen within the alveolar lumina, in the perivascular space of small blood vessels, and in bronchus associated lymphoid tissue and lymph nodes.
Non-Nano Titanium Dioxide Sunscreen Technologies Comparison of the transmittance curves of a Non-Nano TiO2 (red curve) and an ultra fine grade TiO2 (blue curve) dispersed in the same ester. Inorganic UV filters have been manufactured during the past forty years for use in sunscreen products. They are preferred over organic UV
The particle size distribution has a significant effect on many titanium dioxide pigment properties. Light scattering is affected by the mass of titanium dioxide particles between approximately 0.1 and 0.5µm in size. The optimum size for the scattering of visible light is about 0.2µm.

What Is ABC Fast Phonics? As a child struggling to learn to read, I was overwhelmed by the terminology of diphthongs, homonyms, synonyms and similes. And while my patient mother could tell me each word I didn't know, I would struggle with frustration until she'd decided I'd made sufficient effort. There's a better way, I thought. ABC Fast Phonics has come about because my husband and I share the philosophy that learning shouldn't be so hard and is most effective when easy. Therefore this program presents only the basics of phonics, including rules for vowels, consonants, and blends along with practice pages.
Reliable data on how many people get head lice each year in the United States are not available; however, an estimated 6 million to 12 million infestations occur each year in the United States among children 3 to 11 years of age.
Getting head lice is not related to cleanliness of the person or his or her environment. Head lice are mainly spread by direct contact with the hair of an infested person. The most common way to get head lice is by head-to-head contact with a person who already has head lice.
Head lice are small, flat insects; the adults are about 1/8 inch in length. They have no wings, and they do not fly or jump. Their color varies from a dirty white to grayish black. Head lice have sucking mouthparts and suck blood.
Six to 12 million kids in the U.S. get head lice each year, and just as many tears are shed by kidsand adultstrying to get rid of them. Prescription insecticides can be toxic, and over-the-counter treatments may not work.
1 Head lice are spread by personal contact or the sharing of combs, brushes, caps, and other clothing. 2  Head lice are a common problem with preschool and schoolchildren. 3  Head lice cause a tickling feeling of something moving in the hair, itching, and sores on the head.
To survive, adult head lice must feed on blood. An adult head louse can live about 30 days on a person's head but will die within one or two days if it falls off a person. Adult female head lice are usually larger than males and can lay about six eggs each day.
The eggs are glued to the hair shaft very close to the scalp. Head lice live only about 30 to 40 days. They die in 1 or 2 days when removed from the head, and eggs die soon after being removed from the warm scalp. Head lice do not wander about rugs, furniture, or school buses seeking a host.
When a large number of lice live and multiply on a person, it is called an infestation. Three different kinds of lice live on humans: 1  Head lice are usually found in hair, most often on the back of the neck and behind the ears. 2  Head lice are common in preschool and elementary school-age children.
Six to 12 million kids in the U.S. get head lice each year, and just as many tears are shed by kidsand adultstrying to get rid of them.
Illustration of egg on a hair shaft. (CDC Photo). Egg/Nit: Nits are lice eggs laid by the adult female head louse at the base of the hair shaft nearest the scalp. Nits are firmly attached to the hair shaft and are oval-shaped and very small (about the size of a knot in thread) and hard to see.

Three Parts: Preparing for the Meeting Finding the Right Meeting For You Attending the Meeting. Going to your first Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meeting can be challenging. You likely don’t know what to expect or you have false images about AA meetings from the media, pop culture, and other alcoholics. Some people are court ordered to go to meetings and may feel resentful about being forced to attend.
As part of AA protocol, meetings always start on time, on the dot. Try to get to the meeting 5 minutes early or right on time to ensure you can find a seat and get comfortable. 1  AA meetings always last one hour, and no longer.
1 Once you find your first meeting, you will be able to get a list of other meetings there. 2  The meeting list will provide the name of the meetings, the time and place of the meetings, and what kind of meetings are available in your area.
The Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) 12-Step recovery program is a free treatment program for people suffering from alcohol abuse and addiction. AA program participants follow a set of recovery steps to achieve and maintain abstinence from alcohol. Many people use a sponsor to help them through the process.
Any local treatment facilities will also provide you with a free local list of meetings. 1  Once you find your first meeting, you will be able to get a list of other meetings there. 2  Besides the types of AA meetings, there are also certain group distinctions for each chapter.
AA states that its primary purpose is to help alcoholics to stay sober and help other alcoholics achieve sobriety . With other early members Bill Wilson and Bob Smith developed AA's Twelve Step program of spiritual and character development.
Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) is an international mutual aid fellowship founded in 1935 (two years after the end of prohibition in the United States in December 1933) by Bill Wilson and Dr. Bob Smith in Akron, Ohio.
The AA 12 Steps. The 12 steps of AA are as follows: Many alcoholics have a hard time admitting that they can't control their alcohol use. Once they acknowledge that they are unable to stop on their own, the recovery process can begin.
AA accepts people of all faiths, even atheists and agnostics. However, nonreligious people may find themselves more comfortable in a secular 12-Step alcoholics support group or a non-12-Step addiction recovery program.
While Wilson and Smith credited their sobriety to working with alcoholics under the auspices of the Oxford Group, a Group associate pastor sermonized against Wilson and his alcoholic Groupers for forming a secret, ashamed sub-group engaged in divergent works. By 1937, Wilson separated from the Oxford Group.

What should you know about supplemental vitamins and minerals before you head to the pharmacy? What should you know about iron, calcium, fluoride and combination multivitamins for infants and children? Most children do not need supplemental vitamins or minerals. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, a diet based on the food guide pyramid provides adequate amounts of all the vitamins a child needs.
However, a deficiency of iron is much more common in adolescence than in middle childhood. Once girls begin men­struation, they need much more iron than boys do. The best sources of iron include beef, turkey, pork, and liver. Spinach, beans, and prunes also contain modest amounts of iron.
Multivitamins for infants are available as drops and usually contain Vitamin A, Vitamin C, and Vitamin D. They may also have added iron (see above) and other vitamins and minerals, such as thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, pyridoxine, Vitamin B12, and Vitamin E. 1  Tri-Vi-Sol Drops. 2  Poly-Vi-Sol Drops.  Gerber Vitamin Drops.
The Institute of Medicine recommends 600 IU daily for children ages 1 and up. That’s significant: Your child gulps down about 120 IU in a cup of fortified milk. Most infants will need a vitamin D supplement, but breast-fed babies require it for a longer period of time. And deficiency can happen at any age, so ask your child’s doctor what’s best. Factor in fatty acids.
Talk wth your pediatrician about your child’s needs, and see our advice below on vitamins and supplements for children. For you, see our advice on vitamins and supplements for adults. Don’t let Junior pick the product.
Iron is essential. Iron is a common area in which kids are deficient; children between 6 months and 2 years and teenage girls, especially athletes, tend to be more susceptible. If you notice your child seems less active than usual or has trouble learning, ask your pediatrician to test for iron deficiency.
Supplemental Vitamins and Minerals for Children. Most children do not need supplemental vitamins or minerals. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, a diet based on the food guide pyramid provides adequate amounts of all the vitamins a child needs.
The body needs these vitamins in only tiny amounts, and in a balanced diet they are usually present in sufficient quantities in the foods your youngster eats. Thus, in middle childhood, supplements are rarely needed. For some youngsters, however, pediatricians may recommend a daily sup­plement.
As much as possible, try to maximize the vitamins your child receives in her regular meals. Following are some of the vitamins and minerals necessary for normally growing children, and some of the foods that contain them. Vitamin A promotes normal growth, healthy skin, and tissue repair, and aids in night and color vision. Rich sources include yellow vegetables, dairy products, and liver.
Still, there are situations where children's vitamins are necessary, especially if your child is a very picky eater or has a poor diet, that doesn't include a lot of iron rich foods. Some vegetarians may also need vitamins to meet all of their nutritional needs.

Transmission of pathogen can occur in various ways including physical contact, contaminated food, body fluids, objects, airborne inhalation, or through vector organisms. The point of the body where a pathogen enters is called the locus.
The term usually refers to the transmission of microorganisms directly from one individual to another by one or more of the following means: 1  droplet contact – coughing or sneezing on another individual. 2  direct physical contact – touching an infected individual, including sexual contact.

Corriente cattle are a breed of cattle descended from Spanish animals brought to the Americas in the late 15th century. The meat from Corriente is significantly leaner than the meat from most modern beef cattle. All our Corriente cattle have been raised here on our property, fed grass, and been kept in a stress free environment. Corrienties are naturally leaner than English bred cows, such as Angus or Herefords, and are a healthy alternative for those looking to cut down on their fat intake.
The Corriente can be traced back to the first cattle brought to the new world by the Spanish as early as 1493. These cattle were hardy breeds chosen especially to withstand the ocean crossing and adapt to their new land. They were brought to the West Indies and south Florida, as well as to Central and South America.

Since 2008, Android has seen numerous updates which have incrementally improved the operating system, adding new features and fixing bugs in previous releases. Each major release is named in alphabetical order after a dessert or sugary treat; for example, version 1.5 Cupcake was followed by 1.6 Donut.
Android is a mobile operating system (OS) currently developed by Google, based on the Linux kernel and designed primarily for touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets.
Variants of Android are also used on notebooks, game consoles, digital cameras, and other electronics. As of 2015, Android has the largest installed base of all operating systems. It is the second most commonly used mobile operating system in the United States, while iOS is the first.
They typically combine the features of a cell phone with those of other popular mobile devices, such as personal digital assistant (PDA), media player and GPS navigation unit. Most smartphones can access the Internet, have a touchscreen user interface, can run third-party apps, music players and are camera phones.
How Do You Know If You Have Constipation. Most of the time, people just simply know when they are suffering from constipation, but since I’m explaining constipation, it is worth stating what the symptoms of constipation are just in case you’re not sure.
If wasted food is left decaying in your body then the following medical conditions could be a result: 1  1. Fecal Impaction. 2  2. Varicose Veins. 3  3. Hemorrhoids (Piles) 4  4. Anal Tears And Fissures. 5  5. A Prolapsed Rectum. 6  6. Diverticular Disease.
Your diet should contain at least 6 ounces of whole-grains. Fruits and Vegetables Fruits and vegetables are the source of natural fiber that can cure the problem of constipation.
If you’re constipated, try not to eat too many foods with little or no fiber, such as. cheese. chips. fast food. ice cream. meat. prepared foods, such as some frozen meals and snack foods. processed foods, such as hot dogs or some microwavable dinners.
Honey works as a natural laxative. All you need to do is take a tablespoon full of honey in the warm water empty stomach, early in the morning. You can take it twice a day for better results. Lack of fiber in the diet can cause serious constipation problems.
How To Get Rid Of Constipation Immediately And Naturally. There are so many different ways to get rid of your constipation floating around the website which is why I have brought them all together in one place. Everyone is different and so what might work brilliantly for others might not work brilliantly for you.
Constipation is most commonly caused by having too much-processed food in your diet and therefore, a change of diet is recommended. Processed foods usually have a lot of calories but the very little nutritional value which is why digestive systems find it hard to break processed foods down.
Fruits and Vegetables. Fruits and vegetables are the source of natural fiber that can cure the problem of constipation. Take at least 5 portions of fruits and vegetables a day. Your diet should have fruits like bananas, apples, peaches, apricots, grapes , pears, oranges and berries to cure the problem. The vegetables that should be a part of your diet, to treat constipation are spinach, broccoli, carrots, sweet potatoes, peas and cauliflower. Olive Oil A teaspoon full of extra virgin olive oil, empty stomach in the morning can treat your constipation problem.
What Is Constipation. As we eat food, our digestive system will break it down so that the body can absorb all the nutrients and water. However the digestive system cannot break all food down and so this then becomes a stool, more commonly known as poo.
This is best taken though with food that is high in fiber so that it can thoroughly clean out your colon as well as feed the good bacteria to prevent any future bouts of constipation. Turkey Rhubarb Turkey rhubarb is another very powerful herbal remedy that will give your intestines a much needed cleanse to help get rid of your constipation.
1 Even if you don’t use a cell phone for hours each day, research has revealed that after just 50 minutes of cell phone exposure, the emitted radiation increases brain cell activity in the region closest to the cell phone antenna.
The use of cell phones seem to be a mandatory device for the modern age, as it gives us access to voice and data services in almost every part of the world. However, there is a downside effect to our dependence on them. Studies have found that chronic cell phone use may have a negative impact on long-term health, as the following information provides an overview of the effects of cell phone use on our lives. There is a growing concern that increasing exposure to radio frequencies heightens the risk of cancer.
Increases Stress Levels. The high frequency of cell phone use can have negative effects on our stress levels. The constant ringing, vibrating alerts, and reminders can put a cell phone user on edge.
The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) suggests cell phone users to keep a minimum distance of 20 centimeters from their handset to significantly reduce radiation exposure. Adults and especially children can suffer the long-term effects of radiation waves on the brain.
Researchers found high mobile phone use was associated with stress and sleep disturbances for women, whereas high mobile phone use was associated with sleep disturbances and symptoms of depression in men. Overall, excessive cell phone use can be a risk factor for mental health issues in young adults.
By Dr. Mercola If you're an avid cell phone user who refuses to believe that holding this radiation-emitting device next to your head poses a potential health risk, take note... Italy's supreme court has ruled that a man's brain tumor is, in fact, linked to his heavy cell phone use.
A cell phone is a two-way microwave-radiating device whose long-term use has been associated with not only brain tumors but 7 cancers in all, including glioma, acoustic neuroma, meningioma, salivary gland tumors, eye cancer, testicular cancer and leukemia, along with a wide range of other biological effects.
This projection was based on well-established effects of cell phone radiation on DNA mutations, along with the finding that mobile phone use decreases the efficiency of the repair of mutated DNA.
Back pain is also common with increased cell phone use, especially if you hold the phone between your neck and shoulders as you multitask. Long periods of cell phone use cause you to arch your neck and hold your body in a strange posture. This can lead to back pain, says Healthcentral.com.
Even if you don't use a cell phone for hours each day, research by leading brain imaging researcher Nora D. Volkow, MD of the National Institutes of Health, revealed that after just 50 minutes of cell phone exposure, the emitted radiation increases brain cell activity in the region closest to the cell phone antenna.
by Jay Behm-A very basic way to estimate the cost of building a detached garage is to simply apply a typical average per square foot construction of $30 to $40.That is for an average cost basis for having a contractor / builder build a basic one story garage for you on your property.ut for now this will get you in the ballpark of cost to build your new garage. Foundation/Slab Cost: $_____________________________________. The most reliable method for rough cost estimating of concrete foundation and slab work is to contact a local concrete contractor-one who specializes in this work.
Provide a few details about your project and receive competitive quotes from local pros. The average national cost to build a garage is $23,573, with most homeowners spending between $14,621 and $32,525.When it comes to building a garage, a lot of factors come into play, which mimic other large-scale building projects.rovide a few details about your project and receive competitive quotes from local pros. The average national cost to build a garage is $23,573, with most homeowners spending between $14,621 and $32,525.
For the building of the garages, the typical costs will include: 1  Two car-According to Hanley Wood and their Remodeling magazine, the cost to construct a standard two-car garage addition is $58,432.2  This translates to $86 per square foot; and.or this discussion we will assess the costs of building detached a two-car as well as a four car garage. The measurements of the average two car model is 26'x26'or 676 square feet. The average square footage of a four car garage is 48'x30' or 1440 square feet.
1 According to author Stu Silverman the average cost of adding a garage begins at roughly $7,500, and for a two-car garage the average costs will go much higher. 2  This sort of structure will average at $27,040. 3  The resale value of this update would hold at $21,635, or a nearly 81% return on investment.or the garage addition, the typical costs include: 1  According to author Stu Silverman the average cost of adding a garage begins at roughly $7,500, and for a two-car garage the average costs will go much higher. 2  The above figures place the garage addition at $40 per square foo t.
1 Upgrading the quality of materials can bump the cost to $55 a square foot, or $13,200 for a minimum single-car structure, $21,000 for a two-car garage and $47,000 or more for the dream version. Accomplished do-it-yourselfers can cut costs considerably; materials for a single-car garage with a door but no windows start at $3,000-$4,000, depending on the size and style.
For the garage addition, the typical costs include: 1  According to author Stu Silverman the average cost of adding a garage begins at roughly $7,500, and for a two-car garage the average costs will go much higher.2  This sort of structure will average at $27,040.or the garage addition, the typical costs include: 1  According to author Stu Silverman the average cost of adding a garage begins at roughly $7,500, and for a two-car garage the average costs will go much higher. 2  The above figures place the garage addition at $40 per square foo t.
If you are in an area with higher-than-average cost of living you can use $50 to $55. If there are complications or you prefer top quality materials and components the price can go up.So, generally speaking, a 24 ft.sq., two car, basic garage will cost in the range of $17,000 to $23,000.ut for now this will get you in the ballpark of cost to build your new garage.

Adding a garage to a home can require an extensive amount of work, and for this project we will assess the cost of building an attached garage of 676 square feet (26'x26') to a pre-existing home (this is going to easily accommodate two vehicles, provide storage and even have room for a small work area).or the garage addition, the typical costs include: 1  According to author Stu Silverman the average cost of adding a garage begins at roughly $7,500, and for a two-car garage the average costs will go much higher. 2  The above figures place the garage addition at $40 per square foo t.
How much does it cost to build a garage? Cost to build a new 2 car garage will vary from $30 to $41 per square foot for standard construction including labor cost and materials prices.he city or village will define the cost of the permit, but on average the price will vary from $190 to $270. Permits for building a garage can be easily obtained by a homeowner. If a contractor will get the permit the cost will be included in the final estimate.
1 Concrete footings and slab to grade - The average price of concrete is $75 per cubic yard, with the full slab it that would require roughly 13 cubic yards for the two car version at a cost of $975, while it would take 27 cubic yards for the four car version at a cost of $2025;or this discussion we will assess the costs of building detached a two-car as well as a four car garage.

Affixes (prefixes and suffixes) are added to the root. to create a new word. Example: The Latin root “ject” means “throw”, So project can mean “to throw forward”. • A root can be at the front, middle or end. of a word. • Many words in the English language are.
#74 bi → twice. Quick Summary. The English prefixes bi-, derived from Latin, and its Greek variant di- both mean “two.” The Latin prefix is far more prevalent in common words, such as bilingual, biceps, and biped; the more technical Greek di- appears in such words as diphthong and dilemma.
I presume these prefixes are either of Greek or Latin origin, but from what little I know of these two languages, neither uses these prefixes as their numbers. That is, in Greek you wouldn't start counting by saying, Uni, di, tri, quad, ... etymology numbers latin.

In many electronic circuits series resistors are used to get a different voltage across one of the resistors. We'll look at those circuits, called voltage dividers, in a short while. Here's the circuit diagram for a voltage divider.
1 In the first glob you have two resistors in series. Only the leads of the series combination are available for measurement externally. You have no way to penetrate the box and measure things at the interior node.  In the second box you have a single resistor that is equal to the series equivalent.
Operational amplifier applications. A non-ideal op amp's equivalent circuit, showing a finite input impedance, non-zero output impedance, and a finite gain. This article illustrates some typical applications of operational amplifiers. A real op amp has a number of non-ideal features as shown in the diagram, but here a simplified schematic notation is used, and the reader is reminded that many details such as device selection and power supply connections are not shown.
Given a circuit with a number of resistors, Be able to determine resistor combinations within the circuit where two or more resistors can be combined. Be able to replace series and parallel resistor combinations with the correct equivalent resistors.
1 Carbon, Film and Wirewound are all types of resistors. 2  Resistor colour codes are used to identify the resistance and tolerance rating of small resistors.  The BS1852 Standard uses letters and is used to identify large size resistors.

Let's look at the model again. We see that the wires are actually small resistors (small value of resistance, not necessarily physically small) in series with the light bulb, which is also a resistor. We have three resistors in series although two of the resistors are small.

Resistors and Their Uses. Resistors are electrical components that are used in electrical circuits to manipulate current flow. They are individual components and are measured in ohms that range from less than 1 ohm to well over millions of ohms. The higher the value of the resistor, the more resistance it has against current flow.
Input bias currents and input offset[edit] Practical operational amplifiers draw a small current from each of their inputs due to bias requirements (in the case of bipolar junction transistor-based inputs) or leakage (in the case of MOSFET-based inputs).
Diamond clarity is a quality of diamonds relating to the existence and visual appearance of internal characteristics of a diamond called inclusions, and surface defects called blemishes. Clarity is one of the four Cs of diamond grading, the others being carat, color, and cut.IA, as a matter of policy, does NOT grade clarity-enhanced diamonds but it will grade laser-drilled diamonds since it considers the enhancement to be permanent in nature. If you see a GIA Diamond Report with the words clarity enhanced or fracture-filled, it is surely a counterfeit report.
Diamond Clarity Refers to the Absence of Inclusions and Blemishes. Natural diamonds are the result of carbon exposed to tremendous heat and pressure deep in the earth.This process can result in a variety of internal characteristics called ' inclusions ' and external characteristics called ' blemishes .'.iamond Clarity Refers to the Absence of Inclusions and Blemishes. Natural diamonds are the result of carbon exposed to tremendous heat and pressure deep in the earth.
Diamonds with clarity ratings of I1 or higher contain inclusions that are typically undetectable without special magnified viewers. A diamond's clarity rating is based on the size, number, and location of internal and external characteristics.Known as inclusions, internal characteristics include crystals, clouds, and feathers. External characteristics, or surface irregularities, are called blemishes.iamonds with clarity ratings of I1 or higher contain inclusions that are typically undetectable without special magnified viewers. A diamond's clarity rating is based on the size, number, and location of internal and external characteristics.
In diamonds under 1 carat, the same can be said for an SI2 grade. In diamonds over 1 carat (where clarity is more important, and SI2 inclusions are often easier to detect), an SI2 is often half the price of a VS1 diamond.About one third of diamonds sold fall into the SI1-SI2 range.If you are primarily concerned with size and price, I1 may be your best option.he next most popular range is SI1, where the inclusions are usually not significant enough to impact the appearance of the diamond for the casual observer. Often, customers will opt for this clarity range in exchange for a higher cut or color grade.

! Requires oxygen ! Glucose used as fuel without being converted to lactic acid ! Can supply energy for hours ! Fat and protein can be used as fuel. ! Glucose and fat are the 2 major fuels used to make ATP.
While fats and protein are also necessary for energy, they're more of a long-term fuel source, while carbohydrates fulfill the body's most immediate energy needs. It's your body's first source of energy — that's what it likes to use, adds Meyerowitz.
Can supply ATP to muscle for up to 1 -2 minutes ! Carbohydrate (glucose) is the only fuel that is used to make the ATP ! As ATP is produced, lactic acid accumulates & can impair muscle function, cause fatigue. ! When oxygen is available, lactic acid is burned as fuel.
You will probably also wolf down the food, not allowing enough time for your stomach to signal your brain that you are pleasantly full or satisfied. It takes about 20 minutes for your stomach to let your brain know that you have had enough to eat.
If you are not currently eating a mid-morning or mid-afternoon snack, experiment by eating one for a few days and monitor your energy. By fueling your body with a combination of high-quality carbohydrate-and protein-rich foods, you will notice an improvement in how you feel.
ATP (Adenosine triphosphate) is used to power the muscles. ! The energy used by muscles ! Very little ATP is stored in the muscle. ! ATP must be continuously replenished to provide a steady supply of energy to muscles. ! In your body, there are 3 energy systems that make ATP in the muscle cells.
1. Timing. To maintain your energy level, strive to fuel your body consistently throughout the day. If you currently skip a meal, experiment by eating or drinking a nutritious snack and monitor how you feel.
To keep your energy levels stable and reduce the likelihood of overeating, take a few extra minutes each night to prepare healthy snacks for yourself to enjoy between meals. Try low-fat yogurt with berries, part-skim mozzarella cheese with whole grain crackers, or cut-up vegetables with hummus or bean dip.
Most should be whole grains and other complex carbohydrates, but the fiber in fruits and vegetables make them a good simple carbohydrate choice. If you don't get enough carbohydrates, you run the risk of depriving your body of the calories and nutrients it needs, or of replacing healthy carbs with unhealthy fats.
This eating style also reduces your tendency to overeat since you know that you will be fueling your body again in a few hours. If you tend to skip meals or wait longer than four hours to fuel your body, there is an increased likelihood that you will reach that uncomfortable point when you feel ravenous.

Retrograde ejaculation is a condition in men where semen enters the bladder instead of leaving the body through the penis. Normally, when a man ejaculates, semen is propelled down through the urethra and out of the body.
Patients with retrograde ejaculation usually achieve orgasm normally and feel the sensation of having an ejaculation. However, little or no seminal fluid emerges from the penis. Instead the patient often notices that the post ejaculatory urine, i.e. the urine passed after sexual intercourse, is cloudy with semen.
If the cause of retrograde ejaculation is prostate surgery or a problem with anatomy, medication will not help the condition. Surgery is not a treatment option in the vast majority of cases, but there are procedures that can be performed.
Retrograde ejaculation Overview Retrograde ejaculation (which can also present with Anejaculation) as its name implies, is a condition that describes backward flow of seminal fluid into the urinary bladder instead of forward, as is the norm during orgasm.
Causes of Retrograde Ejaculation. Causes of retrograde ejaculation include surgery that involves the prostate, urethra or bladder, medication and some health conditions. Damage to the prostate tissue by radiation therapy or other types of nerve damage in the pelvic area can also cause retrograde ejaculation. Signs and Symptoms Retrograde ejaculation is typically not painful and is only noted by a decrease in the amount of semen that is produced during orgasm.
NY urologist Dr. Eid diagnoses and treats retrograde ejaculation, or the backward flow of semen into the bladder, which results from medications (Flomax), neurological (caused by diabetes) or physical damage to the bladder.
Retrograde ejaculation is a condition in men where semen enters the bladder during ejaculation instead of leaving the body through the penis. Normally, when a man ejaculates, semen is propelled down through the urethra and out of the body. Retrograde ejaculation means that semen is propelled up the urethra, and moves back into the bladder.
Damage to the prostate tissue by radiation therapy or other types of nerve damage in the pelvic area can also cause retrograde ejaculation. Signs and Symptoms. Retrograde ejaculation is typically not painful and is only noted by a decrease in the amount of semen that is produced during orgasm.
If the retrograde ejaculation was caused by medications, discontinuation will usually restore normal function. Surgery of the bladder neck is irreversible and cannot be corrected. Neurological injuries are also permanent in most cases.

Her Majesty’s Inspectorate (HMI) team will conduct their first monitoring visit within four to six months of the school being judged as requiring special measures.The HMI report may, depending on what progress has been made, recommend that the school be taken out of special measures.

Can anyone help what happens when a school goes into special measures and shows. My child school was put in special measures sep they came back few weeks ago and have put on the report no improvements have been made!ow I think the government are very close to withdrawing funding so it will have to close. It could be different if it is not a free school though. It must be a difficult time for you, particularly if you live in an area where there is a pressure on school places so I hope it all turns out OK.
Getting out of Special Measures is possibly the most demanding challenge teachers, and particularly headteachers, can face, says Iain Erskin. Between 2001 and 2003, I found myself leading a school out of Special Measures.I took on the school six months into the process and, what is more, volunteered to do it!n the final visit, the HMI in charge brought with him the inspector who had put theschool into Special Measures. Progress was significant and it was a lovely thought to ask the original inspector back so she could see how the school had been transformed.
For schools in special measures, the first Ofsted monitoring inspection usually takes place between four and six months after the date of the original inspection. Where a school’s safeguarding arrangements have been judged to be inadequate, however, it is likely to take place much sooner than this.eachers working in special measures or notice to improve schools are not only expected to cope with this but may often have lots of extra work, which the head teacher or local authority believe will result in the school being removed from a category of concern.

I imagine it would be different with each school so I'd ask your school what their notice to improve period was and go from there.

According to national benchmarks, physical therapists deliver an average of 3.4 weighted procedures during a physical therapy visit. The average Medicare allowable for services is between $26 and $30 per weighted procedure, bringing a single PT session to a cost of around $100.
The charge for an assessment could be $150 or more. After the assessment, the physical therapist may perform varied sets of procedures for each session. Some procedures are billable by the minute; the charge for gait training could be as high as $115 for each quarter hour, for example.

Farming was very important for the civilizations of the Americas. Both the Aztecs and the Incas were excellent farmers, despite having no animals suitable for pulling plows or carrying heavy loads. Llamas were native to the Andes, but they could only carry small loads. In Mesoamerica, there were no pack animals at all.

The Technology of the Incas and Aztecs Overview. When Spanish conquistadors arrived in the Americas in the 1500s, among the native civilizations they encountered were two great empires. The Aztec Empire covered much of central Mexico, and had its capital at Tenochtitlan, the site of modern Mexico City.

Complex civilizations like those of the Aztecs and Incas required the keeping of records. The Aztecs used hieroglyphs, or picture-writing, to represent objects and ideas in carvings, paintings, and long strips of paper called codices.
Inca agriculture was also characterized by the variety of crops grown, the lack of a market system and money, and the unique mechanisms by which the Incas organized their society. Andean civilization was pristine -- one of five civilizations worldwide which were indigenous and not derivative from other civilizations.
Turquoise and jade were particularly favored. When the conquistadors arrived in the Americas in the sixteenth century, they were probably shocked by the practice of human sacrifice, but the lure of the gold and jewels they found led to atrocities of their own.
The Incas, from their capital at Cuzco, ruled a territory that stretched 4,000 miles along the western coast of South America and up into the Andean highlands. These civilizations never developed the wheel or used animals for hauling, and the Incas had no system of writing. Nevertheless, they built great cities with highly developed religious, political and economic structures, and were accomplished in the arts, creating fine jewelry, textiles and pottery.
Incan agriculture. Incan Agriculture was the culmination of thousands of years of farming and herding in the high-elevation Andes mountains of South America, the coastal deserts, and the rainforests of the Amazon basin. These three radically different environments were all part of the Inca Empire (1438-1533 CE) and required different technologies for agriculture.
Land use. Inca farmers learned how to best use the land to maximize agriculture production. This expressed itself in the form of stone terraces to keep the important Andean soil from eroding down the mountain side.
Sed rate, or erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), is a blood test that can reveal inflammatory activity in your body. A sed rate test isn't a stand-alone diagnostic tool, but it may help your doctor diagnose or monitor the progress of an inflammatory disease.
Definition. Sed rate, or erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), is a blood test that can reveal inflammatory activity in your body. A sed rate test isn't a stand-alone diagnostic tool, but it may help your doctor diagnose or monitor the progress of an inflammatory disease.
ESR is an abbreviated form for erythrocyte sedimentation rate. It is often referred to as the sedimentation rate or the sed rate. An ESR blood test is usually done to check and understand the degree of inflammation in the body such as cancers, various kinds of infections as well as autoimmune disorders and diseases.
The sed rate test measures the distance red blood cells fall in a test tube in one hour. The farther the red blood cells have descended, the greater the inflammatory response of your immune system.
Blood tests for ESR or Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate is a measure that is traditionally used to check for inflammation in the body.
ESR is said to be a non-specific test because an elevated result often indicates the presence of inflammation but does not tell the health practitioner exactly where the inflammation is in the body or what is causing it. An ESR can be affected by other conditions besides inflammation.
The problem for sociologists is that these concepts of the individual and society and the relationship between them are thought of in terms established by a very common moral framework in modern democratic societies, namely that of individual responsibility and individual choice.
Microsociology exists both as an umbrella term for perspectives which focus on agency, such as Max Weber's theory of social action, and as a body of distinct techniques, particularly in American sociology.
Myles believes that society is generally unequal. Growing up in a racially divided neighborhood, he witnessed constant clashes, especially between people of different social classes.
The main concepts of macro sociology are: society, culture, social institutions, social system, structure and also global social processes. Macro sociologists argue that society is in a more priority than individual as his behavior is formed by society he was born and brought up in.
Published: 23rd March, 2015 Last Edited: 23rd March, 2015. This essay has been submitted by a student. This is not an example of the work written by our professional essay writers. Explain the differences between Macro and Micro sociology. Identify some of the key sociological approaches in both areas.
As discussed in later chapters, sociologists break the study of society down into four separate levels of analysis: micro, meso, macro, and global. The basic distinction, however, is between micro-sociology and macro-sociology. The study of cultural rules of politeness in conversation is an example of micro-sociology.
Sociologists study all aspects and levels of society. A society is a group of people whose members interact, reside in a definable area, and share a culture. A culture includes the group’s shared practices, values, beliefs, norms and artifacts.
1) According to sociologists, when we are able to step outside the familiar routines of everyday life in order to see things in a different way, we are employing: a) Romanticism. b) the sociological imagination. c) global thinking. d) spiritual enlightenment. 2) According to the sociologists, our behavior is: a) not influenced at all by broader social forces. b) totally controlled by the wider social environment. c) is mostly the result of our genes. d) is influenced by the social world in which we live.
Microsociology is one of the main points (or focuses) of sociology, concerning the nature of everyday human social interactions and agency on a small scale: face to face. Microsociology is based on interpretative analysis rather than statistical or empirical observation, and shares close association with the philosophy of phenomenology.
what symbolic interactionists do. -look at how people make sense out of life and their place in it. -self is a symbol- self consists of the ideas we have about who we are. -self is fluid (constantly changing)- we constantly adjust our views of who we are based on how we define the reactions of others. -macro level. structural fuctionalism founders.
Answers from Sheldon G. Sheps, M.D. Yes. If you have a diastolic number — the bottom number of a blood pressure measurement — less than 90 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) and a systolic number — the top number of a blood pressure measurement — greater than 140 mm Hg, you have a common type of high blood pressure called isolated systolic hypertension.
Systolic blood pressure readings between 130 and 139 or diastolic blood pressure readings between 80 and 89 usually indicate STAGE 1 HYPERTENSION, which means the force of the blood pressure in your arteries is higher than normal, putting you at increased risk of life-threatening problems such as heart attacks and stroke.
Which is more important, the bottom or the top number? We have discovered that systolic blood pressure (the top number or highest blood pressure when the heart is squeezing and pushing the blood round the body) is more important than diastolic blood pressure (the bottom number or lowest blood pressure between heart beats) because it gives the best idea of your risk of having a stroke or heart attack.
In blood pressure readings, which number is more important? The top or bottom? I have heard that they now think the top number is more important than the bottom number in a blood pressure? What is wrong when the lower(2nd) number of a blood pressure reading is under 60? More questions
What Does the Diastolic Blood Pressure Number Mean? The diastolic reading, or the bottom number, is the pressure in the arteries when the heart rests between beats. This is the time when the heart fills with blood and gets oxygen. A normal diastolic blood pressure is lower than 80.
Which number is most important for high blood pressure? for a younger male like myself which number is most important to keep an eye on for CAD heart disease and other issues the top number or the bottom number both mine are always high useally around 160 over 110. but not sure which one is most important.
In the last few years, however, research has emerged that points to the systolic number as important as well, and perhaps more indicative of damage to your cardiovascular system than the diastolic number. In a blood pressure reading, the diastolic number is the force of blood against your artery walls while your heart is at rest (in between heartbeats).
For a normal reading, your blood pressure needs to show a top number (systolic pressure) that’s between 90 and less than 120 and a bottom number (diastolic pressure) that’s between 60 and less than 80.
When comparing your blood pressure numbers to what's considered normal, it's important to look at your: 1  Family history. 2  Overall health. 3  Diet. 4  Lifestyle.

3 relating to or characteristic of a particular field of activity. the technical jargon of linguistics. 4 existing by virtue of a strict application of the rules or a strict interpretation of the wording. a technical loophole in the law, a technical victory. 5 of, derived from, or showing technique.
Abstraction in this sense is typically used in architecture to allow a consistent level of definition and understanding to be achieved in each area of the architecture in order to support effective communication and decision-making.
An ability that an organization, person, or system possesses. Capabilities are typically expressed in general and high-level terms and typically require a combination of organization, people, processes, and technology to achieve. For example, marketing, customer contact, or outbound telemarketing.

Then, $120,000 a year was the median amount Americans said they would need to make in order to think of themselves as rich. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the median annual household income in the United States is roughly $50,000 per year. The Gallup poll finds those below that level typically saying they would need to earn $100,000 or more in annual income to be rich.
When people are asked how much it would take to be rich, they tend to give a number twice as much as their current income. If you make $50,000 a year, someone who makes $100,000 qualifies as rich. If your annual income is $100,000, $200,000 is enough.
If you have an expensive taste for vacations, jewelry, or cars, it’s going to take ultra-wealthy levels of income to satisfy your hunger for luxury, which is probably why 8% of investors interviewed by the Spectrem Group 2013 interview said $100 million is what sets apart the rich from “just” upper-middle class.
According to the CBO, between 1979 and 2011, gross median household income, adjusted for inflation, rose from $59,400 to $75,200, or 26.5%. However, once adjusted for household size and looking at taxes from an after-tax perspective, real median household income grew 46%, representing significant growth.
Estimates of the amount of savings a person needs to be rich are generally similar by subgroup, though college graduates report a median of $1 million and college nongraduates of $500,000. Implications. Americans generally would consider themselves rich if they made $150,000 per year or had $1 million in net worth.
If you earn more than $250,000, you are limited in how much you can claim in itemized deduction and personal exemptions; and you will be hit with the new 3.8% net investment income tax that started on January 1, 2014. Moreover, if you make more than $400,000, your tax rate rises to the ultra-rich tax bracket of 39.6%.
The U.S. Census Bureau reported in September 2016 that real median household income was $55,775 in 2015, a 3.8% increase over the $53,713 amount for 2014. This was the third consecutive year with a statistically significant increase by their measure.
The Census Bureau reports income from several major household surveys and programs. Each differs from the others in some way, such as the length and detail of its questionnaire, the number of households included (sample size), and the methodology used.
U.S. real (inflation adjusted) median household income was $51,939 in 2013 versus $51,758 in 2012, statistically unchanged. In 2013, real median household income was 8.0 percent lower than in 2007, the year before the latest recession.
The most basic way to do it: look at the income distribution and pick a cutoff. According to the World Top Incomes Database, a household income of about $113,000 lands you at the top 10th, while $394,000 makes you a bona fide member of the 1 percent. You could reasonably argue that anybody who earns above those thresholds is, in a sense, rich—or at least makes a relatively uncommon amount of money.
The state budget agreement reached by Gov. Andrew Cuomo and legislative leaders increases funding for Catholic and other religious and independent schools by $13.5 million over the governor’s proposed budget released in January.
The restoration comes after a strong lobbying effort by the New York State Catholic Conference and a coalition of independent and religious schools, as well as in response to nearly 14,000 email message sent by members of the Catholic Action Network.
Religious and independent schools received just over $94,000,000 in Mandated Services Aid in this year’s budget, as well as $43.5 million for Comprehensive Attendance Policy reimbursement. The Catholic Conference represents New York State’s Bishops in matters of public policy.
No. School districts where all of the schools in the district receive Title I funding and charter schools that receive Title I funding are not mandated to set aside a portion of such funding for students who are homeless.
However, while the majority of states prohibit aid to religious schools, 29 states permit state funding for transportation to nonpublic schools, while 21 states allow state aid for private school students' textbooks and other instructional materials.

Charter schools receive less funding than traditional public schools on average, according to a new report -- but some experts say that the funding gap isn't necessarily unfair, and that the report's methodology masks fundamental differences between charter and public school populations.

Purpose of Grant. The purpose of the Expanded Prekindergarten for Three-and Four-Year Old Students in High Need School Districts is to increase the availability of high quality prekindergarten placements for high need children and schools within New York State.
Title I funding cannot be used to supplant services required under the McKinney-Vento Act. A June 2014 Field Memo from the NY State Education Department authorizes school districts to use Title I funds to pay for the cost of transporting students in temporary housing.

Research shows that the hormone testosterone does impact sex drive — as well as remedy other sexual problems — in certain women with sexual dysfunction. But the long-term safety of testosterone therapy for women is unknown. For this reason, some doctors are hesitant to recommend it.
The low limit of testosterone levels in men is about 300 nanograms per deciliter and the upper normal limit is approximately 1000-1200 ng/dl. A low level needs to be investigated further to distinguish it from normal aging.
The amount and levels of hormones change daily. The sex hormones, estrogen and testosterone, are secreted in short bursts -- pulses -- which vary from hour to hour and even minute to minute. Hormone release varies between night and day and from one stage of the menstrual cycle to another.
Testosterone is a hormone produced primarily in the testicles. Testosterone helps maintain men's: 1  Bone density. 2  Fat distribution. 3  Muscle strength and mass. 4  Facial and body hair. 5  Red blood cell production. 6  Sex drive.
It’s produced during pregnancy. Estradiol is the primary sex hormone of childbearing women. It is formed from developing ovarian follicles. Estradiol is responsible for female characteristics and sexual functioning. Also, estradiol is important to women's bone health.
Men can experience many signs and symptoms as they age. Some may occur as a result of lower testosterone levels and can include: 1  Changes in sexual function. 2  This may include reduced sexual desire, fewer spontaneous erections — such as during sleep — and infertility. 3  Changes in sleep patterns. 4  Sometimes low testosterone causes insomnia or other sleep disturbances.
1 Low testosterone (low-T) is underproduction or lack of production of testosterone. 2  Causes of low-T include chronic medical conditions such as diabetes, infections, obesity, or other hormonal conditions. 3  Symptoms of low-T include: 4  change in sleep patterns,
Testosterone belongs to a class of male hormones called androgens. But women also have testosterone. The ovaries produce both testosterone and estrogen. Relatively small quantities of testosterone are released into your bloodstream by the ovaries and adrenal glands. In addition to being produced by the ovaries, estrogen is also produced by the body's fat tissue.
Testosterone therapy might be appropriate if: 1  You have reduced sex drive, depression and fatigue after surgically induced menopause, and estrogen therapy hasn't relieved your symptoms. 2  You are postmenopausal, taking estrogen therapy and have a decreased sex drive with no other identifiable causes.
Testosterone therapy comes in many forms, such as creams, gels, patches or pills. The method of administration and dose relate to safety risks, so it's important to discuss pros and cons with your doctor. Testosterone preparations are not approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in women.

At first glance, it might seem that if a system has a high availability then it should also have a high reliability. However, this is not necessarily the case. This article will explore the relationship between availability and reliability and will also present some of the specified classifications of availability.
Reliability, availability, and maintainability (RAM) are three system attributes that are of tremendous interest to systems engineers, logisticians, and users. Collectively, they affect economic life-cycle costs of a system and its utility.
In reliability theory and reliability engineering, the term availability has the following meanings: 1  The degree to which a system, subsystem or equipment is in a specified operable and committable state at the start of a mission, when the mission is called for at an unknown, i.e. a random, time. Simply put, availability is the proportion of time a system is in a functioning condition.
Reliability, maintainability, and availability (RAM) are three system attributes that are of great interest to systems engineers, logisticians, and users. Collectively, they affect both the utility and the life-cycle costs of a product or system.
Testability of a system should also be addressed in the availability plan as this is the link between reliability and maintainability. The maintenance strategy can influence the reliability of a system (e.g. by preventive and/or predictive maintenance), although it can never bring it above the inherent reliability.
Reliability Basics. Relationship Between Availability and Reliability. Availability is defined as the probability that the system is operating properly when it is requested for use. In other words, availability is the probability that a system is not failed or undergoing a repair action when it needs to be used.
The system has a reliability of exp(-8760/683.8) = 0.00027%. The reliability value is the. probability of completing the one year mission without failure. In short, the system is highly. unreliable (for a one year mission time) and maintenance actions are in high demand as the system.
probability that a repairable system or system element is operational at a given point in time under a given set of environmental conditions. Availability depends on reliability and maintainability and is discussed in detail later in this topic (ASQ 2011).
Consider these elements of the effectiveness equation for refineries and chemical plants. In many. continuous process industries, availability is high (~85 to 98%), reliability is low (~0.001 to 10%) when measured against turnaround intervals, and maintainability is high (~50 to 90%) when.
Data in Table 1 shows mean down time due to maintenance actions is 9.4 hours. system maintainability using the exponential distributions and an allowed repair time of 10 hours. The system has a maintainability of 1-exp(-10/9.4) = 65.5%. probability of completing the repairs in the allowed interval of 10 hours.

Hydrodynamic dispersion includes both mechanical dispersion and molecular diffusion spreading out the solute in direction of flow (longitudinal dispersion) and perpendicular to it (transverse dispersion). Hydrodynamic dispersion in flow direction is expressed by Eq. (2):(2).he product of longitudinal dispersivity and advective velocity is known as mechanical dispersion described in the previous paragraph. 3.4. The Peclet Number. At a low solute velocity, diffusion is an important contributor to the hydrodynamic dispersion.
DL = longitudinal hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient, DT = transverse hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient, a L = longitudinal dispersivity, and a T = transverse dispersivity.Or as shown in Zheng & Bennett for two dimensions. At low velocities, diffusion dominates. At high velocities, dispersion dominates.ee figure 2-5 (Zheng & Bennett).

Note that the concentration front has the shape of an error function for the continuous source and a normal distribution for the point source.he product of longitudinal dispersivity and advective velocity is known as mechanical dispersion described in the previous paragraph. 3.4. The Peclet Number. At a low solute velocity, diffusion is an important contributor to the hydrodynamic dispersion.
We use the term h ydrodynamic dispersion to denote the spreading (at the macroscopic level) that results from both mechanical dispersion and molecular diffusion. Actually, the separation between the two processes is rather artificial, as they are inseparable.he components of are related to the property of the porous medium to disperse a component, to the velocity of the fluid, and to molecular diffusion, by. (4.19). where is the magnitude of the average velocity, and Pe is a Peclet number, defined by.
Can create a transport equation for solutes to describe the processes of advection and dispersion. C = concentration, Cs = concentration at source/sink, Dij = hydrodynamic dipserion coefficient, vi = average linear flow velocity, qs = source/sink term, and q = porosity. where.ee figure 2-5 (Zheng & Bennett). For dispersion, we assume that. 1  Mechanical dispersion is describe by Fick's Law. 2  Mechanical dispersion is a function of the average linear flow velocity.
Hydrogeology is an interdisciplinary subject; it can be difficult to account fully for the chemical, physical, biological and even legal interactions between soil, water, nature and society. The study of the interaction between groundwater movement and geology can be quite complex.s the field of hydrogeology matures, the strong interactions between groundwater, surface water, water chemistry, soil moisture and even climate are becoming more clear. For example: Aquifer drawdown or overdrafting and the pumping of fossil water may be a contributing factor to sea-level rise.

Window air conditioners are portable, but they are heavy and can't be rolled to another room. In most cases, you'll leave a window air conditioner in the window. If it's not a reverse cycle air conditioner, you might remove it during the cooler months, but you may need two people to carry the unit.
Cost to install portable air conditioning varies greatly by region. To get free estimates from local contractors, please indicate yours. (portable A/C cool only for a 340 sq.ft. room - upgraded) Prices range from $345 (portable A/C cool only for a 340 sq.ft. room - DIY) to $902 (portable A/C cool and heat for an 800 sq.ft.
Step 6: Position the portable air conditioner a few feet from the window. Connect the exhaust hose (if you need to lengthen it, pull gently) to the opening in the window panel fixture. Depending on the model, the hose should lock, twist or snap into place. Step 7: Plug in the power cord and prepare to cool off.
The size (capacity) of a portable air conditioner is a measurement of the area it is able to cool. The measurement is based on the power output of the air conditioner. If you buy an electric air conditioner, its size will be measured in kilowatts (kW).
Step 4. That gap between the frame of the lower sash and the window on the upper sash needs to be filled. If your air conditioner comes with a foam seal, you can cut it to size and slip it in place. If your foam filler disappeared during the winter while the air conditioner was in storage, you can buy them separately.
Typical cost is about. $532. (portable A/C cool only for a 340 sq.ft. room - upgraded) Prices range from $345 (portable A/C cool only for a 340 sq.ft. room - DIY) to $902 (portable A/C cool and heat for an 800 sq.ft. room - upgraded) and also vary depending on your zipcode:
If you choose a gas portable air conditioner, the capacity will be measured in BTUs: 1  7500 BTU will cool a 150m2 room. 2  9000 BTU will cool a 200m2 room. 3  10,000 BTU cools 250m2.  12,000 to 13,000 BTU cools 300m2.
The hot air exhaust will occupy a partial window space, or other zone opening. You will find that the cost of average portable A/C varies by type of unit, its cooling (and heating) capacity and efficiency rating, preparation and special needs, and the labor rate.
Apply silicone caulk to rear flange on wall vent. 3. From outside, slide wall vent through hole in wall; secure with stainless steel screws. 4. Twist and lock the flexible duct to the exhaust port on rear of air conditioner unit. 5. Connect the duct end to the wall vent and seal with foil duct tape. 6. Plug air conditioner unit into an electrical outlet. 7. Turn on unit, then set thermostat and, if desired, the automatic timer. 10 to 20 minutes if using existing wall vent; 1 to 2 hours if cutting and installing a new wall vent.
Know Before You Buy Your Window Air Conditioner. 1  Determine the window where you’ll install your air conditioner. If there’s no three-prong outlet nearby, you’ll need an extension cord labeled for air conditioner use. 2  Check the load on the circuit you plan to use.

This compendium is limited to the negotiations phase of. settlements (which includes client counseling). These Guidelines do not. address the enforcement of settlement agreements or requests for. sanctions for conduct in settlement negotiations.
A lawyer shall abide by a client’s decision whether to settle a matter. In a criminal case, the lawyer shall abide by the client’s decision, after consultation with the lawyer, as to a plea to be entered, whether to waive jury trial and whether the client will testify.
As part of this. obligation of competence, a lawyer should give attention to the validity. and enforceability of the end result of the settlement process and should. make sure the client’s interests are best served, for example, by. considering tax implications of the settlement.
ER 1.2 Scope of Representation and Allocation of Authority between Client and Lawyer. (a) Subject to paragraphs (c) and (d), a lawyer shall abide by a client’s decisions concerning the objectives of representation and, as required by ER 1.4, shall consult with the client as to the means by which they are to be pursued.
If an attorney cannot unilaterally decide for a client whether to settle the client’s case, then it necessarily follows that the attorney must have some communication with the client. As a result, we next turn to the lawyer’s ethical duties when his client is missing or otherwise refuses to communicate.
In addition, the comment now provides: At the outset of a representation, the client may authorize the lawyer to take specific action on the client’s behalf without further consultation. Absent a material change in circumstances and subject to ER 1.4, a lawyer may rely on such an advance authorization.
The second question is whether a lawyer who has entered into a binding settlement on behalf of his client without permission can be successfully sued by his client. In other words, can his client recover damages from the lawyer in a separate lawsuit for legal malpractice.
Association and, accordingly, should not be construed as representing the policy. of the American Bar Association. However, the American Bar Association. recommends the Ethical Guidelines for Settlement Negotiations as a resource. designed to facilitate and promote ethical conduct in settlement negotiations.
As a general rule, however, the involvement of a third. party neutral in the settlement process does not change the attorneys’. ethical obligations. The Guidelines are intended to be a practical, user-friendly guide. for lawyers who seek advice on ethical issues arising in settlement. negotiations.
With client consent, a lawyer may use or disclose to third parties. information learned during settlement negotiations, except when. some law, rule, court order, or local custom prohibits disclosure or. the lawyer agrees not to disclose.

To raise a child born in 2013 to the age of 18, it will cost a middle-income couple just over $245,000, according to newly released estimates from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. That's up $4,260, or almost 2%, from the year before.Estimates can vary widely depending on where you live and how much you earn.elated: 'The most surprising cost of raising my kid'. Child care, in particular, is a huge burden -- often costing as much as the family home. In 2012, center-based care for one infant was greater than median rent payments in nearly half of the states, according to Child Care Aware of America's most recent report.
From day care to the monthly grocery bill, the cost of raising a child is climbing at a rate that many families can't keep up with. It will cost an estimated $241,080 for a middle-income couple to raise a child born last year for 18 years, according to a U.S. Department of Agriculture report released Wednesday.That's up almost 3% from 2011 and doesn't even include the cost of college.At the same time, wages aren't keeping up.manda Holdsworth, who lives outside of Detroit with her husband and 22-month-old daughter, pay more than $1,000 a month for their daughter's day care center -- or nearly 15% of their monthly income. The costs are so high that they think twice about having a second child.
The average cost of raising a child born in 2013 up until age 18 for a middle-income family in the U.S. is approximately $245,340 (or $304,480, adjusted for projected inflation), according to the latest annual Cost of Raising A Child report from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.ack then, a middle-income family could have expected to spend $25,230 ($198,560 in 2013 dollars) to raise a child until the age of 18, according to the new report, which also notes that [h]ealth care expenses for a child have doubled as a percentage of total child-rearing costs during that time..
The final tally I know, I know, you’re flabbergasted. Me too. But when we added up all of the expenses we arrived at $243,660 as the total cost of raising a typical child to age 18 (in other words, until the day before his or her 19th birthday). That’s $12,825 per child per year or $1,070 per month.Good lord, that’s $1.45 for every hour that your child is alive.he final tally I know, I know, you’re flabbergasted. Me too.

For the year 2013, annual child-rearing expenses per child for a middle-income, two-parent family ranged from $12,800 to $14,970, depending on the age of the child. The report, developed by the USDA Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion (CNPP), notes that family income affects child-rearing costs.A family earning less than $61,530 per year can expect to spend a total of $176,550 (in 2013 dollars) on a child from birth up to age 18.he average cost of housing for a child up to age 18 is $87,840 for a middle-income family in the urban West, compared to $66,240 in the urban South, and $70,200 in the urban Midwest.

Fancy drinks like caramel extravaganzas can add many more carbs and calories. Even flavored syrups take their toll. One “pump” of flavoring from syrups with sugar has about 5 grams of carb and 20 calories. Usually, 3 of these “pumps” are put into a 12 oz coffee drink, 4 into a 16 oz drink, and 5 into a 20 oz drink. So adding flavored syrup can add 25 grams of carbohydrate and 100 calories to a large drink. On the other hand, sugar-free syrups don’t add any carbs or calories.

Spinal traction is a non-surgical way to relieve pain and correct problems in the spine. While it does have some potential side effects, spinal traction offers consistent relief for most people. Risks
The goals of surgical treatment are to alleviate neural compression (decompression) and, in selected patients with a deformity or instability, to stabilize the spine (fusion), so as to prevent further spinal compression and recurrent symptoms. [3-8] Image courtesy of Wikimedia Commons.
Spinal traction is a form of decompression therapy that relieves pressure on the spine. It can be performed manually or mechanically. Spinal traction is a form of decompression therapy that relieves pressure on the spine. It can be performed manually or mechanically. Spinal traction is used to treat herniated discs, sciatica, degenerative disc disease, pinched nerves, and many other back conditions.
In this case, the surgeon used a combination of local bone graft and recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 (rhBMP-2) for the posterior fusion (an off-label use of the product). Image courtesy of Anne Vinsel, MS, MFA.

Manual spinal traction. In manual spinal traction, a physical therapist uses their hands to put people in a state of traction. Then they use manual force on the joints and muscles to widen the spaces between vertebrae. Mechanical spinal traction. In mechanical spinal traction, you will lie on a table that has special tools to stretch the spine.
At home, I used the over the door 'hanging' unit with a bag of water for weight. At many of the different Physical therapy centers, I had traction done on all areas. The basis is that traction can help in 'stretching' your spine, your discs and therebye reducing some of the pain associated with many spinal problems. But keep one thing in mind, never use cervical traction after you had cervical surgery with fusion. Bottom line, traction can be helpful, as long as it done under a physicians instructions The DRX9000 machine really is not much more than a traction machine.
In selected patients (eg, those with a deformity or spondylolisthesis), a spinal fusion with instrumentation is required. Spinal pedicle screws with connecting rods provide direct fixation into the vertebrae and increase spinal stability, thereby improving the chances of successful fusion. A successful spinal fusion requires osseous growth of the vertebrae and the bone graft together.
1 To provide short-term ventilatory support: Appropriately applied IPPB therapy improves the distribution of ventilation in patients with ventilation-perfusion mismatch, and has a great potential for decreasing the incidence of postoperative atelectasis and pneumonia.
Discontinue medication if adverse reactions occur. Adverse reactions may include wheezing, rapid heart rate, lightheadedness, excitability, anxiousness. 10. Continue treatment until all medication is used or prescribed length of time has elapsed.
8. Have the student breathe slowly through the mouth and hold breath for 1 – 2 seconds, then exhale through the mouth piece. When coughing occurs, remove mouthpiece and allow student to clear secretions completely before continuing treatment.
IPPB machine 2. Tubing 3. Nebulizer, including cup and mouthpiece 4. Medication and diluent Physician orders must specify: 1. Frequency of treatment: _____________________________________ 2. Length of treatment: ________________________________________3.
Patients afflicted with diseases that limit the depth of breathing can be have their V. increased, sometimes as much as fourfold, with IPPB. The single overall clinical goal of IPPB therapy is to provide patients with a significantly larger V. at a physiologically advantageous inspiratory-to-expiratory pattern than the they can produce with spontaneous ventilation.
B. An Intermittent Positive Pressure Breathing (IPPB) machine assists the pupil in getting medication into the lungs and in loosening mucus so that it can be coughed up. A. Medication placed in the nebulizer cup is converted into a fine mist which is delivered to the lungs.
1 The optimal breathing pattern to reinflate collapsed lung units with IPPB consists of slow, deep breaths that are sustained or held at end-inspiration. 2  This type of inspiratory maneuver increases the distribution of inspired gas to areas of the lung with low compliance, specifically, the atelectatic areas.
To provide an atmosphere of high humidity to assist the break-up of pulmonary and bronchial secretions. B. The IPPB machine delivers air or oxygen under positive pressure during inspiration. It automatically turns on when the pupil breaths in, and automatically shuts off when the preset pressure is reached.
On an intermittent basis, IPPB treatments usually last 15 to 20 minutes, and may be given several times each day. Short-term use is for purposes of assisting ventilation, and may be provided over a period of several hours, such as overnight. Overview. IPPB was came into use as a clinical modality in 1947, and since then it has had a roller-coaster type history. When it was first introduced, IPPB enjoyed almost immediate widespread acclaim, and was used for a broad range of clinical conditions. By 1970, despite a sparcity of clinical evidence supporting its use, IPPB had become the preeminent mode of respiratory therapy.
IPPB (Intermittent positive pressure breathing pressure) therapy is defined as the therapeutic application, usually via a mask or mouthpiece, of inspiratory positive pressure to the airway of a spontaneously breathing patient on an intermittent or short-term basis by an trained respiratory care practitioner (RCP).
Leadership of the organization, newly-elected every four years, establishes the theme, focus and direction of the sorority's international program which is implemented at the local, national and international level.
The service programs of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Incorporated are consistently centered around significant issues that affect society. This tradition of service in social activism continues to characterize the sorority and its members in their respective communities and the global community at-large.
Implementation of the Alpha Kappa Alpha's international program and the internal management of the sorority's policies and protocols, is spearheaded by the chairmen of its International Committees.
If you’re a female college student interested in acquiring membership for either Alpha Kappa Alpha or Delta Sigma Theta, it would be a good idea to attend events hosted by either sorority. In this way, you would have an idea how things are run in that sorority.
Good sororities such as the Alpha Kappa Alpha and Delta Sigma Theta hold meetings and nurture their members even beyond college. Summary: 1. Alpha Kappa Alpha and Delta Sigma Theta are prominent sororities. 2. Alpha Kappa Alpha was formed in 1908 at Howard University. Five years later, some members of the sorority broke away and founded Delta Sigma Theta.
deltA,zetA,sigmA vs. Alpha Kappa Alpha!! Sororities may hold the same principles and purposes, but what makes them different than any other sorority is the unique characteristics and history. They may believe in the same purpose to strive for success and manage to help out the community, but what led them to believe this is very different.
There are many issues over how and why Delta Sigma Theta got started but are were because of ignorance to history. The second issue between Alpha Kappa Alpha and Delta Sigma Theta is what do they do to stimulate the community. Delta Side: We are about politics and AKA’s only have a social calendar who throw parties and other organizations of that matter to stimulate the community.
Alpha Kappa Alpha and Delta Sigma Theta are two prominent sororities which have garnered good reputation through the years. The difference between the two stems from the fact that Alpha Kappa Alpha came first. The sorority was founded in 1908, at the Howard University. However, five years later, some members of Alpha Kappa Alpha broke away and formed the Delta Sigma Theta.
Leadership within the sorority extends beyond the International President to also include a Board of Directors (Directorate), comprised of other international officers, and 10 Regional Directors who oversee the management of the sorority's 986 chapters throughout the country and several foreign countries.
(dividing lines). Sororities may hold the same principles and purposes, but what makes them different than any other sorority is the unique characteristics and history. They may believe in the same purpose to strive for success and manage to help out the community, but what led them to believe this is very different.
It might be that he or she will not want to do the work if the healing will be compromised. This is something that you and the artist will have to deal with. No matter how eager you are to go ahead with the tattoo, the artist has to think of the possible consequences for both of you if things go wrong. Some people worry about infections or HIV. Going only to a reputable shop will reduce the likelihood of that to the bare minimum.
I had a nice tattoo applied to my ankle at a tattoo show on the Queen Mary. It was an impulse decision, something I ordinarily advise strongly against. But it definitely made a mediocre already-existing design look better, so I went for it. I’m not sorry I did. But that’s how I learned I’ve got problems with red ink. Fortunately, as you can see in the photo, there’s not a lot of red ink in the design. But those small red areas remained swollen, itchy, and intermittently crusty for close to two years after I got the tattoo.

Report Abuse. looks like it's healing nicely. but never put A&D lotion on a tat again. that's stupid. it just covers the tat with a film, doesn't let the tat breath and stains your clothes. use baby lotion.
This gives the skin proper time to start the healing process, allowing epidermal layers to seal around the pigment. A couple of hours one way or the other won't hurt, but once the bandage is removed, don't rebandage it. We use thick, absorbent, non-stick ABD wound dressings to protect the tattoo.
If you're not allergic to tattoo goo or similar products, invest. They're made specifically to help the healing of your new tatt. Now, it will remain red, and it will start itching (if not already). Try not to use scented soap on your neck and keep shampoo away from it just to make sure.
Massaging in a lotion at this time can satisfy the itch. Total regeneration of the healing skin can take from 4 to 6 weeks. In my opinion, this is the best and safest, tried and true way to take care of a new tattoo. I have been recommending and using this method myself since 1978.
You can always go back to your artist if you have questions. They should be able to help you figure out if it is healing properly. Whatever you do, DO NOT PULL OFF THE SCABS. Pulling the scabs will make the ink fall out of the tattoo and ruin it for life. Not to mention you will have to go get it re-done.
Soaking will turn a new tattoo to slush and have the same after effect as using too much ointment and take a long, long time to heal. The initial healing of a new tattoo is about 2 weeks, if taken care of properly. The tattoo will lightly flake and peal like a sunburn, but with colored flakes of skin. This is normal and will take place all within the first 4 to 7 days.
If the skin itches, slap it. If it is peeling, put lotion on it. And if it is scabbing, just leave it alone. Your tattoo is almost healed, and now is not the time to ruin it! Protection from the sun. After your tattoo is healed, from now on, you will always want to protect it from the sun's ultraviolet rays.

The Step-up-as the name implies-is nothing more complex than stepping up onto an object, then stepping back down from it. Although it is an incredibly simple exercise, there are a few things to be aware of. Factors to consider. Perhaps the most important of these is the height of the step. The basic exercise works the hips and thighs, and the step height adjust things in favour of the quadriceps or hamstrings. A higher step works the hamstrings harder, a lower step targets the quads (1).
Start as you would for a Sumo squat with your legs wide and toes pointing slightly out. Arms can be on top of your head or crossed in front of you at shoulder height. Lower down into a low squat.
Editor’s note: This is a guest post from Joel Ohman. Ah, the squat. Certainly one of the manliest exercises around, and for good reason. You can make a strong case that the squat is the best exercise you can possibly do.
Some may scoff at it, but most people work out with an eye on improving their physique, so these benefits do rank high on a lot of people’s priority list. When you add the RDL (or any other hip extensor exercise) into your program, your best bet is to split your leg work up over two different days. Day one, use a quad intensive exercise; day two, use a hip extensor intensive exercise.
Barbell Front Squat. This is likely the second most popular barbell squat exercise (after the standard barbell “back” squat) and targets the quads, core, and stabilizers a little more than the regular barbell squat.
Barbell Squat. The classic squat. If you can only choose one of these squat exercises to do, then this is the one. From the classic 5×5 Workout Plan to the Arnold Schwarzenegger Workout Plan –pretty much every legitimate classic weight training workout incorporates the barbell squat.
Bodyweight step-up. The simplest form is a bodyweight-only step-up onto anything of a reasonable height (usually something below knee height). The speed, number of reps and step height will all play roles in the effectiveness of this exercise for your goals.
So if you want to start working out like a king, here is the ultimate guide to performing 35+ different squat exercises–some of them bodyweight exercises and many of them using weights. Don’t try them all out at once; with the squat you really need to concentrate on using proper form.
Leg curls are not hip dominant exercises. To qualify as one, there has to be movement at the hip joint, and the leg curls simply do not do this, making them a poor choice for balancing the strength levels between the two main sections of the upper leg.
Take a few steps back, and set yourself for the exercise. Being set includes making sure your feet are shoulder width apart, your chest is up, your lower back has a slight curve in it, and your knees are slightly bent (not locked). Once set you’re ready to start the exercise. Start by tightening your core musculature (abs and lower back) to ensure a secure spine.

The White House responded to Donald Trump keeping 1,000 jobs in the US by dropping a huge fact bomb that showed just how little Trump has accomplished compared to President Obama. The Hill reported that Press Secretary Josh Earnest said that the White House was pleased that the jobs were staying, then he added:
FUN FACT: More net jobs have been created under Obama than both Bushes combined. The economy under President Obama seems difficult to defend — unless you put it in context. Here are the facts: When I took office, businesses were laying off 800,000 Americans a month. Today, our businesses are hiring 200,000 Americans a month.
The White House responded to Donald Trump keeping 1,000 jobs in the US by dropping a huge fact bomb that showed just how little Trump has accomplished compared to President Obama. “If [Trump] is successful in doing that 804 more times, then he will meet the record number of manufacturing jobs” created during Obama’s eight years in office. Earnest went further, saying that the roughly 800,000 jobs he cited were new jobs created under Obama’s watch.
Dec. 1, 2016. (The White House) During a press briefing on Dec. 1, 2016, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Mr. Trump would have to make 804 more announcements just like [the Carrier deal] to equal the standard of jobs in the manufacturing sector that were created under President Obama. Dec. 1, 2016.
There were 805,000 manufacturing jobs that weren’t just protected or saved, but actually created while President Obama was in office. So President Obama has set a high standard, and President-elect Trump can meet that standard if this Carrier deal is completed in the way that he expects that it will be.
More net jobs have been created under Obama — 5,142,000 as of the August jobs report — than under George H.W. Bush — 2,637,000 — and George W. Bush — 1,282,000 — combined, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. You should rightfully point out that crediting jobs created to a president exclusively is stupid.
White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said that 805,000 manufacturing jobs have been created since President Barack Obama has been in office. In fact, there has been a net loss of 303,000 manufacturing jobs since January 2009. Earnest made the statement during a press briefing on Nov. 30.
(For the record, the 10-million-jobs-added figure Obama cited is just private-sector jobs and excludes much of Obama's first year in office.) But we wondered if, in the past six years, U.S. job growth has surpassed other leading economies by such a wide margin.

Indeed, the 277 move game was played in a tournament on the Internet Chess Club. Oddly enough, I found that the average length of a game (played by humans) is roughly 40 moves. Based on the statistics provided by the Chessgames database (685,801) games, the average number of moves is 40.04.
Opening statistic for chess players is based on ECO (Encyclopedia of Chess Openings) classification. The Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings is a classification system for the opening moves in a game of chess. It is presented as a five volume book collection (now also a computer database) describing chess openings.
Longest game. The longest tournament chess game (in terms of moves) ever to be played was Nikolić–Arsović, Belgrade 1989, which lasted for 269 moves and took 20 hours and 15 minutes to complete a drawn game.

The following statistics give an insight into our database of chess games and the people who use it. Tell me some general statistics about the database.
I know of no competitive chess in the US where each move is timed. It just doesn’t happen that way. In the analog clock days, 40/2 g30 was the usual time control, that’s 120 minutes for the 1st 40 moves, and an additional 30 minutes for the remainder of the game. Division suggests that’s 3 minutes per move, but of course, that’s not how it works out. Clearly, some moves can be made quickly.
For other chess games or other uses, see Chess (disambiguation). Chess is a two-player strategy board game played on a chessboard, a checkered gameboard with 64 squares arranged in an 8×8 grid. The game is played by millions of people worldwide. Each player begins with 16 pieces: 1 king, 1 queen, 2 rooks, 2 knights, 2 bishops, and 8 pawns.
Blitz has typical time limits of 5 minutes for each player for all of the moves. Rapidplay is played with typical time limits of 30 minutes for each player for all the moves. Local league chess has typical time controls of 35 moves in 75 minutes and then perhaps 15 or 20 minutes to finish the game. International chess has a standard time control of 40 moves in 2 hours and then an extra hour to reach move 60. After this, if the game is still in progress a quickplay finish decides the game.
The players agreed to a draw after the 10th move by White (Petrosian). The shortest decisive, non-forfeited world championship game occurred between Viswanathan Anand and Boris Gelfand in game 8 of the World Chess Championship 2012. Gelfand resigned after Anand's 17th move, 17.Qf2.
#5 Jan 7, 2014. thanks friends! for giving your valuable opinions. 1) but chess is a game to think in advance and ahead. this way tactics and postions of playing gets developed. 2) whenever a move is made, there has some logic behind it. 3) the more u can predict the moves, the more powerful is the player's game. thanks.
Today, even a run-of-the-mill chess app on a smartphone is strong enough to routinely beat anyone below master level. An average chess program on an average computer can evaluate millions of moves per second, according to Kenneth W.

The human brain is a unique and complex structure; it facilitates vital and complicated physiological and psychological functions such as consciousness, mobility, emotion, and personality. Different parts of the brain are responsible for specific functions.
PARTS OF THE BRAIN The human brain is hugely interconnected but three major components can be identified: the cerebrum, the cerebellum and the brain stem.
The brain is the most complex part of the human body. This three-pound organ is the seat of intelligence, interpreter of the senses, initiator of body movement, and controller of behavior.
Brain Tour. 1. Three pounds, three parts. Your brain is your most powerful organ, yet weighs only about three pounds. It has a texture similar to firm jelly. It has three main parts: 1  The cerebrum fills up most of your skull.
1 Central nervous system (CNS): a part of the nervous system which includes the brain and spinal cord. 2  Parasympathetic nervous system: the part of your nervous system that unconsciously controls your organs and glands when your body is at rest.

1 The brain is divided into two halves (hemispheres). 2  The left half controls movement and sensation in the right side of the body, and the right half controls movement and sensation in the left side. 3  Thus, damage to the right side of the brain may cause movement problems or weakness on the body's left side.
The Cerebrum: The cerebrum or cortex is the largest part of the human brain, associated with higher brain function such as thought and action. The cerebral cortex is divided into four sections, called lobes: the frontal lobe, parietal lobe, occipital lobe, and temporal lobe.
The Human Brain. The human brain is a unique and complex structure; it facilitates vital and complicated physiological and psychological functions such as consciousness, mobility, emotion, and personality. Different parts of the brain are responsible for specific functions.
Deep inside the medial temporal lobe is the region of the brain known as the limbic system, which includes the hippocampus, the amygdala, the cingulate gyrus, the thalamus, the hypothalamus, the epithalamus, the mammillary body and other organs, many of which are of particular relevance to the processing of memory.

Medical marijuana in Pa.: Entrepreneurs position, prepare for new industry.
Before Pennsylvania became the 24th state to legalize medical marijuana, a state Senate panel estimated the legislation would spur a new industry that could one day net more than $600 million a year statewide (though more conservative estimates say it’ll be something like $125 million in year one.)
For example, the Pennsylvania Medical Society, which represents doctors, opposes legalizing medical marijuana at this point, citing lack of research. However, the medical society favors removing marijuana from Schedule I, to open the door to more research.

Pennsylvania patients moved one step closer to access on January 17 when the Pennsylvania Health Department released applications for grower/processor and dispensary permits. The department will announce a first round of approvals — up to 12 grower/processor permits and up to 27 dispensary permits — in late June.
The latest on medical marijuana in Pennsylvania. The latest on medical marijuana in Pennsylvania. It's been six months since Gov. Tom Wolf signed a law legalizing medical marijuana in Pennsylvania, and already some seriously ill children have access to the drug.
The backdrop: a new law and developing program. The law sets standards for tracking plants, certifying physicians and licensing growers, dispensaries and physicians. Patients will be able to take marijuana in pill, oil, vapor, ointment or liquid form but won't be able to legally obtain marijuana to smoke or grow.
There is near 90 percent support for medical marijuana among Pennsylvania residents, and strong, bi-partisan support in the House. State Rep. Mike Regan, R-Dillsburg, a task force member, said he believes a bill might be passed before legislators leave for the summer.

A bond, by nature can only earn so much interest during its lifespan.Most of the time, the returns are not that high when you compare them to other investments.owever, here are a few reasons that you might want to stay away from bond funds. 1. No Control. One of the biggest drawbacks to investing in a bond fund is that you have no control over what happens.

The annual interest rate for EE Bonds issued between May 1, 2015, and October 31, 2015, is 0.30% . EE Bonds issued in May 2005 and after earn interest for up to 30 years.

If you own a bond fund with a 5 year duration and there is a sudden 2% increase in interest rates, your fund would lose 10% of its value. So in today’s low interest rate environment, it doesn’t make much sense to invest in bond funds with medium to high durations since their expected returns are so low.his chart shows that the returns for a 100/0 portfolio are similar to 80/20 but you take on significant more risk/volatility for a very meager increase in returns.

In today's lousy interest rate return market, buy only short-term corporates.
The knowledge that you will get a set price for your investment in 10 years' time is of much less value than if it will happen in just one year, say, so long-dated bonds are much more volatile and sensitive to wider interest rates.he knowledge that you will get a set price for your investment in 10 years' time is of much less value than if it will happen in just one year, say, so long-dated bonds are much more volatile and sensitive to wider interest rates.

The chain is what should be lubricated most often. At winter, if you are cycling in the rain for a long period of time you should lubricate your chain as soon as you get home. (After having dried it of course). In the summer, if you are riding every day, I would lubricate the chain once or twice a month.To lubricate the chain spin it whilst dripping small amounts of lubricant on chain links. Then shift through all the gears and spin the chain so that it works its way around the different components.Leave the chain to dry and wipe off any excess. The chain should feel only slightly moist to touch.o lubricate the chain spin it whilst dripping small amounts of lubricant on chain links.

Take the rag in your palm and wrap it around the chain. Hold on tightly. Turn the cranks a couple of times while holding the rag around the chain firmly. This works best if you hold the upper portion of the chain, the one that's closest to the saddle (seat). After applying the lubricant to the chain, you may want to gradually shift through all of the gears so that they are all well-oiled before the ride too. 2  Get a thin oil, such as bicycle chain lube. 3  Avoid the thick, greasy type of lubricants.

After you’ve cleaned it, and occasionally in any case, you should lubricate your bike. We strongly recommend that you use bicycle specific lubricants. 1  Lube the Chain. 2  Wipe your chain with a rag, then apply a thin bead of lube to it while turning the crank.3  DO NOT OVERDO IT! Too much lube will actually cause dirt to stick to the chain, making it gummy and grim. Clean your Drivetrain. 2  Spray your chain with a cleaner/degreaser, and work on it with a rag. 3  There are various chain cleaning gadgets that enable you to wash a chain without removing it from the bike, but a good wipe down with a rag and some solvent does a pretty good job, too.

Here's a simple rundown of what codec packs are and when you should use them. Note: This post really applies to Windows only. Mac users have a codec pack called Perian which works great, and is useful if you want to watch videos in QuickTime or iTunes rather than VLC.
If you have to use a codec pack, we recommend using a minimal one like K-Lite Basic or Combined Community Codec Pack (CCCP). They're simple, only install a few codecs, and is less likely to interfere with anything on your system (nor will they install any crapware).
1 If you use Windows Media Player or have a home theater PC that uses Windows Media Center, your codec support is limited, and you'll want a codec pack to beef it up.
1 Install Instructions. 2  Click the Download button on this page to start the download. 3  Do one of the following: 4  To start the installation immediately, click Open or Run this program from its current location. 5  To copy the download to your computer for installation at a later time, click Save or Save this program to disk.
That said, there are a few exceptions where codec packs might be necessary: 1  If you use Windows Media Player or have a home theater PC that uses Windows Media Center, your codec support is limited, and you'll want a codec pack to beef it up.
Dear Lifehacker, I've heard of (and even sometimes used) video players like VLC when Windows Media Player prompts me to download new codecs, but I've also heard people talk about codec packs like K-Lite, Shark007, and CCCP.
Close. This package can be used as an alternative to automatically downloading Windows Media Codecs, or to correct problems experienced with previously-downloaded codecs. 1  Details.
(2) In telecommunications, (short for coder/decoder) a device that encodes or decodes a signal. For example, telephone companies use codecs to convert binary signals transmitted on their digital networks to analog signals converted on their analog networks.
2) The term codec is also an acronym that stands for  co mpression/ dec ompression.. A codec is an algorithm, or specialized computer program, that reduces the number of bytes consumed by large files and programs. In order to minimize the amount of storage space required for a complicated file, such as a video, compression is used. Compression works by eliminating redundancies in data.
1) In communications engineering, the term codec is used in reference to integrated circuits, or chip s that perform data conversion. In this context, the term is an acronym for  co der/ dec oder.. This type of codec combines analog-to-digital conversion and digital-to-analog conversion functions in a single chip.

Renewable energy sources include solar energy (which comes from the sun and can be turned into electricity and heat), wind energy, geothermal energy (from inside the earth), biomass from plants, and hydropower from water are also renewable energy sources.enewable energy sources include all fuel types and energy carriers, different from the fossil ones.
RENEWABLE ENERGY AND ALTERNATE ENERGY SOURCES. Renewable energy is sustainable as it is obtained from sources that are inexhaustible (unlike fossil fuels). Renewable energy sources include wind, solar, biomass, geothermal and hydro, all of which occur naturally.ENEWABLE ENERGY AND ALTERNATE ENERGY SOURCES. Renewable energy is sustainable as it is obtained from sources that are inexhaustible (unlike fossil fuels). Renewable energy sources include wind, solar, biomass, geothermal and hydro, all of which occur naturally.
Fossil fuels are non-renewable, that is, they draw on finite resources that will eventually dwindle, becoming too expensive or too environmentally damaging to retrieve. In contrast, the many types of renewable energy resources-such as wind and solar energy-are constantly replenished and will never run out.Most renewable energy comes either directly or indirectly from the sun.Sunlight, or solar energy, can be used directly for heating and lighting homes and other buildings, for generating electricity, and for hot water heating, solar cooling, and a variety of commercial and industrial uses.n contrast, the many types of renewable energy resources-such as wind and solar energy-are constantly replenished and will never run out. Most renewable energy comes either directly or indirectly from the sun.
Types of Energy Sources. There are two types of energy sources, Renewable and Non-Renewable sources. Renewable energy sources are sources that can be replenished or which are available naturally in excess. Non-Renewable energy sources are limited in their availability.ypes of Energy Sources.

Non-Renewable energy sources are limited in their availability.
Sustainable energy are not just a part of renewable energy sources, they are also the sources of energy that can best be used to power homes and industries without any harmful effects being experienced.ind Energy. Wind is a sustainable energy source. It is available naturally and can be tapped to produce vast amounts of power that can be used in many ways and places. For instance, sailors tap this energy to help the ship propel through its various directions to distant shores for trading.
Renewable energy is generally defined as energy that comes from resources which are naturally replenished on a human timescale, such as sunlight, wind, rain, tides, waves, and geothermal heat.enewable energy resources exist over wide geographical areas, in contrast to other energy sources, which are concentrated in a limited number of countries.
10 hilariously insightful foreign words. Many sustainable energy sources are being used to provide energy to people around the world. The motion of the wind and water are often used as sustainable energy sources as are the heat from geothermal vents and the light from the sun.Biofuels are also replacing the unsustainable fossil fuels that many people rely on for most of their energy needs.he sun is one of the most commonly used sustainable energy sources. Solar panels use photosensitive cells to collect and generate energy from solar radiation. The main drawback of this energy source is that power can only be collected when it is sunny out.

iOS 9.1 has a limited number of outward facing changes. It includes support for Unicode 7 and 8, introducing a range of new emoji like...burrito, cheese wedge, middle finger...and more.
Galvin explains, what are kernel & user modes, instruction privileges given for both modes & also about mode-bit. But I am interested to know how mode changes from one to another. Basically I want to solve following question : A CPU has 2 modes, privileged and non-privileged.
from user mode to kernel mode-Hardware Interrupt is needed [like in Disk I/O]. Now, in case user program tires to access an memory which is beyond its permissible range, a trap occurs, which is basically a software interrupt which will be handled by OS. Now, in user mode we cannot execute any privileged instructions.
MORE. Apple releases iOS 9.1. The download includes the now-obligatory new emoji—150 of the little blighters (notably the magical pointy chap illustrated above). It improves Live Photos and Messages. It also lets Sprint users join the Continuum party.
… Apple said it fixed a denial-of-service issue in the kernel, and a privacy flaw where...notifications may appear on the lock screen even when the setting is turned off. MORE. Well, that was fast. … The jailbreaking community already knew that Apple had patched these exploits in iOS 9.1.
Now coming to, kernel to user mode. The OS can change kernel to user mode. So, it will simply run a privileged instruction to change from kernel to user mode. It does not need to generate either H/w or S/w interrupt. So I conclude, to change. from previledged to non-previledged-a privileged instruction will do.
The kernel is responsible for deciding which memory each process can use, and determining what to do when not enough memory is available. Input/output (I/O) devices. I/O devices include such peripherals as keyboards, mice, disk drives, printers, network adapters, and display devices.
A kernel connects the application software to the hardware of a computer. The critical code of the kernel is usually loaded into a protected area of memory, which prevents it from being overwritten by other, less frequently used parts of the operating system or by applications.
In computing, the kernel is a computer program that manages I/O requests from software, and translates them into data processing instructions for the central processing unit and other electronic components of a computer. The kernel is a fundamental part of a modern computer's operating system.
To perform useful functions, processes need access to the peripherals connected to the computer, which are controlled by the kernel through device drivers. A device driver is a computer program that enables the operating system to interact with a hardware device.
Prostate cancer primarily affects the male urinary and reproductive systems. Urinary problems can include difficulty starting and stopping urination or a weakened urine stream, feeling the need to urinate more than usual, blood in the urine, or a burning sensation during urination.
There are two primary disorders that affect the male reproductive external organs. These include penis disorders and testicular disorders. Disorders of the penis and testes can affect a man's sexual functioning and fertility. The testicles, also called testes, are part of the male reproductive system.
The most common effect of cancer therapy on the male reproductive system is infertility (the inability to initiate a pregnancy). Infertility can occur as a result of certain types of chemotherapy, radiation to the brain or testicles, or surgery involving the male reproductive system.
The male reproductive system is made up of the scrotum, testicles, vas deferens, epididymis, seminal vesicles, prostate gland, penis, and urethra. The reproductive system is controlled by the pituitary gland in the brain. The testicles are located in the scrotum (the loose pouch of skin that hangs behind the penis).

Of male-specific diseases of the reproductive system, prostate cancer is the most common, but men can also suffer from testicular and penile cancer, according to the American Cancer Society. Treatment for prostate cancer depends on the age, severity of the disease and other health conditions of the patient.
Disorders of the penis and testes can affect a man's sexual functioning and fertility. The testicles, also called testes, are part of the male reproductive system.
Prostate cancer is a disease which only affects men. Cancer begins to grow in the prostate-a gland in the male reproductive system. The word prostate comes from Medieval Latin prostate and Medieval French prostate.
Salter Harris Fractures 4 and swelling around or near the end of a long bone. Precise diagnosis can only be certain with radiographic images (Salter, 1999, pp. 499-504). A mnemonic used to help remember the five different types of Salter-Harris fractures are given in a manual that is used as
Growth plate fractures happen to children's growing bones. The Salter-Harris system classifies them to guide how they are treated and the prognosis. Growth plate fractures happen to children's growing bones.
Based on the clinical history and radiographs shown, this patient has sustained a supination-inversion type ankle fracture. An inability to reduce the fracture in a closed manner warrants an open approach to remove interposed structures and to confirm anatomic reduction.
Salter-Harris Type I Fracture. The Salter-Harris Type I fracture is considered the “simplest” in the classification system. That is not to say these injuries cannot be serious.
Objectives. 1  Describe pediatric bony anatomy. 2  Identify a Torus or Buckle fracture and describe its clinical significance. 3  List the different classifications of Salter Harris Fractures I-V. 4  Describe the clinical significance and treatment options for Salter Harris Fractures.
The Foot and Ankle Online Journal 3 (7): 2 Salter Harris Type II ankle injuries are reviewed in 10 cases. Potential premature physeal closure (PPC) is a real complication in most open reductions of this fracture.
For purposes of this wiki I will discuss Salter-Harris fractures that are classified into 5 types. 1  Type I is a fracture through the growth plate. 2  Type II extends through the metaphysis and the growth plate. 3  Type III is a fracture through the growth plate and the epiphysis. 4  Type IV extends through the epiphysis, the growth plate and the metaphysis.
A broken ankle, also called an ankle fracture, is a common childhood injury. An ankle fracture is a break in one or more of the bones that make up the ankle: the tibia, fibula, and talus. Ankle fractures in children are more likely to involve the tibia and fibula (the long bones in the lower leg) than the talus (a smaller bone in the foot).

Well, it’s not bad for them. And that’s for sure. Baby lotion basically is a chemical and alcohol free lotion that can moisturize, protect and nourish your babies’ skin, and if it’s good for your baby it’s most definitely okay for adults to use too.
Despite all the rumors regarding mineral and baby oil, both are perfectly safe for your skin. Mineral oil has been regulated and controlled by the FDA. In addition, it is purified and refined, which makes it safe to be used on the skin and is a fantastic moisturizer too. Baby oils are used on babies for maintaining their supple skin. However, its use is not limited to babies only. Since baby oil is mild and contains few chemical agents, it is great to be used by adults too. Baby oil can be used for numerous purposes, such as removing makeup and softening the skin without harming it.
How to Moisturize Your Skin Using Baby Oil. Baby oil isn’t just for babies. The aromatic oil is merely mineral oil with a bit of fragrance, which makes it a good skin moisturizer for people of all ages. Baby oil hydrates and locks moisture into your skin. Pick up a bottle — or borrow from baby — and use it in place of body lotion.

An IQ test score is calculated based on a norm group with an average score of 100 and a standard deviation of 15. The standard deviation is a measure of spread, in this case of IQ scores. A standard devation of 15 means 68% of the norm group has scored between 85 (100 – 15) and 115 (100 + 15).
70% of IQ scores fall between 85 and 115. 95% of IQ scores fall between 70 and 130. 99.5% of IQ scores fall between 60 and 140. Low IQ & Mental Retardation. An IQ under 70 is considered as mental retardation or limited mental ability. 5% of the population falls below 70 on IQ tests.
A standard deviation in IQ points is 15, so 68.2% of the population will have scores between 85 and 115. This is labeled an average IQ, which is just a name for a group of people scoring around the average score. This name for a group helps make it easier to group test takers together.
Last 10 results of this IQ Test : The bell curve (also called a normal curve or normal distribution) is a graph that shows approximately how much of the population falls into each IQ range. In theory, if we tested everyone in the world with a traditional IQ test, most people would score in the  Average range.
Also, 95% of the norm group has an IQ score within two standard deviations of the average. So, 95% of the norm group has a score between 70 (100 – 30) and 130 (100 + 30). This means scores of over 130 only occur in 2,5% of cases.
About 95.4% of the population will have an IQ score between 70 and 130, which is everyone within two standard deviations. Scores that are between 70 and 85 may be labeled below average, while scores between 115 and 130 could be labeled above average.
About 2% of the population has an IQ score lower than 69. Such a low IQ score often is hard to measure using a regular intelligence test. Very high IQ scores are also hard to determine accurately. This is because you need a lot of reference measurements to determine a specific score reliably.
Einstein was considered to only have an IQ of about 160. Mensa is a society for people with high IQ, in the top 2% (1 in 50). In 1926, psychologist Catherine Morris Cox published a study of the most eminent men and women who had lived between 1450 and 1850 to estimate what their IQs might have been.
The standard deviation is a measure of spread, in this case of IQ scores. A standard devation of 15 means 68% of the norm group has scored between 85 (100 – 15) and 115 (100 + 15). In other words, 68% of the norm group has a score within one standard deviation of the average (100).
50% of IQ scores fall between 90 and 110. 70% of IQ scores fall between 85 and 115. 95% of IQ scores fall between 70 and 130. 99.5% of IQ scores fall between 60 and 140. Low IQ & Mental Retardation. An IQ under 70 is considered as mental retardation or limited mental ability.
The neurons carrying information to the SCN, however, take a different path. They exit the optic chiasm and turn upward, toward the SCN (suprachiasmatic means above the chiasm). The SCN is a small, paired, wing-shaped structure in the hypothalamus, located at the base of the brain. The animation shows the isolated left SCN, optic nerve, and eye, while the right SCN is shown embedded within the hypothalamus in the brain. Within each side of the SCN is a network of up to several thousand neurons.
A. The hypothalamus is the only brain region that both sends and receives information to the body via the blood stream. B. The hypothalamus has the greatest concentration of nuclei at which physiological set points are encoded, monitored, and controlled.
This nucleus sits in the floor of the tuberal region of the hypothalamus. Both of these nuclei, along with the supraoptic nucleus, located just above the optic chiasm in the anterior region of the medial zone extending laterally into the lateral zone, have key roles in neuroendocrine regulation.
The Hypothalamus Gland. The hypothalamus is part of the brain lying under the thalamus. The stalk of the pituitary gland is attached to the hypothalamus. The main function of the hypothalamus is homeostasis, or maintaining the body's status quo.

The hypothalamus has the most complex circuitry of any brain region. Like other brain areas there are neural interconnections. But unlike other brain areas, there are also extensive non-neural communication pathways between the hypothalamus and other brain regions and the periphery.
The preoptic area of the hypothalamus contains thermo-sensitive neurons; these are important for TRH (thyrotropin releasing hormone) secretion. The hypothalamus receives many inputs from the brainstem; notably from the nucleus of the solitary tract, the locus coeruleus, and the ventrolateral medulla.
The hypothalamus releases the following hormones: 1  Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH, TRF) – stimulates thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) release from the pituitary. 2  Prolactin-releasing hormone (PRH) – stimulates prolactin release from the pituitary. 3  Dopamine (DA) - inhibits prolactin release from the pituitary.
Summary. In mammals, the controlling clock component that generates a 24-hour rhythm is the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), located in a part of the brain called the hypothalamus.
A. The hypothalamus is the only brain region that both sends and receives information to the body via the blood stream. This answer is INCORRECT. B. The hypothalamus has the greatest concentration of nuclei at which physiological set points are encoded, monitored, and controlled.
One key function of the hypothalamus is regulation of body functions in concert with the daily light:dark cycle. Intrinsic timing mechanisms of neurons in the suprachiasmatic nucleus controlled by the expression of the light sensitive clock, bmal, per, and cry genes establish the master pacemaker of the body.

Analysis of the levels of toxic metals in urine after the administration of a metal detoxification agent is an objective way to evaluate the accumulation of toxic metals. Acute metal poisoning is rare.
Drinking urine is not poisonous, but just because something isn't toxic doesn't mean it's good for you.
But it does work topically, and that’s scientifically assured and far less grim. Dr Adam Friedmann, consultant dermatologist at The Harley Street Dermatology Clinic, is a big fan of urea (a chemical compound in urine) as an ingredient in skincare.

I can imagine 15 cats could do a lot of damage. My guess is that the urine seeped into the floor under the carpet *and* possibly the subflooring, as well as up into the walls.

Urine is a slightly acidic fluid which carries waste from the kidneys to the outside world. The kidneys have millions of nephrons which filter toxins, waste, ingested water and mineral salts out of the bloodstream. The kidneys regulate blood acidity by excreting excessive alkaline salts when necessary. The chief constituent of the nitrogenous wastes in urine is urea, a product of protein decomposition.

The reasons for these false-negative reactions may include, but are not limited to, the following: 1  Cutaneous anergy (anergy is the inability to react to skin tests because of a weakened immune system) 2  Recent TB infection (within 8-10 weeks of exposure) 3  Very old TB infection (many years)  Very young age (less than 6 months old)
How is it used? Tuberculosis (TB) screening tests are not used as general population screens but are used to screen people who are at high risk for TB exposure, such as: People with diseases or conditions that weaken the immune system, such as HIV or AIDS, which makes them more vulnerable to a TB infection.
Tuberculosis (TB) Testing & Diagnosis. There are two kinds of tests that are used to detect TB bacteria in the body: the TB skin test (TST) and TB blood tests. A positive TB skin test or TB blood test only tells that a person has been infected with TB bacteria. It does not tell whether the person has latent TB infection (LTBI) or has progressed to TB disease.
Tuberculosis (TB) screening tests are not used as general population screens but are used to screen people who are at high risk for TB exposure, such as: 1  People with diseases or conditions that weaken the immune system, such as HIV or AIDS, which makes them more vulnerable to a TB infection.
Q: Who is required to have a TB test? All applicants two years of age or older are required to have a tuberculin skin test (TST). Children younger than age two are required to have a TST if there is evidence of contact with a person known to have TB or if there is other reason to suspect TB. If evidence of TB infection is found, a chest x-ray is required.
The Mantoux tuberculin skin test (TST) is the standard method of determining whether a person is infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Reliable administration and reading of the TST requires standardization of procedures, training, supervision, and practice.
The volunteer office will. provide the dates and times for the test at the Old Bridge location on a monthly. basis. 2* If you are under the age of 18, you must have written parental permission. for the test (orange form included in the application packet). You must bring the. orange permission form with you in order to receive the test. 3* After you receive the skin test, a nurse will give you a form, which.
Response from Samuel L. Katz, MD. Although many recommendations regarding tuberculin skin testing suggest 3 months of age as the optimal time for initiating the test, it is certainly possible to perform a skin test on a newborn.
The CDC lists a preference for the TST for testing children younger than 5 years of age and says that both tests might be useful when someone with a negative initial TST or IGRA test has an increased risk for TB infection and/or clinical suspicion of active tuberculosis exists.
Classification of the Tuberculin Skin Test Reaction. >An induration of 15 or more millimeters is considered positive in any person, including persons with no known risk factors for TB. However, targeted skin testing programs should only be conducted among high-risk groups.

According to the U.S. Department of Education, the maximum time limit is 150 percent of the time enrolled in school. For example, your loan period can last up to six years for a four-year undergraduate program.
Summary: Direct Subsidized Loans (sometimes called Subsidized Stafford Loans) are federal student loans borrowed through the Direct Loans program that offer undergraduate students a low, fixed interest rate and flexible repayment terms.
Stafford and PLUS loans. Both federal student loan programs offer the Federal Stafford Loan and the Federal PLUS Loan for graduate students and for parents of dependent undergraduate students. The main federal student loan is the Stafford Loan.
Interest Rates and Fees. The interest rates on Direct Subsidized Loans are fixed and do not change over the life of the loan. The interest rate for the 2016-2017 academic year is 3.76%. Every year on July 1, interest rates are reset based on current market rates.
Also Known As: FFEL Program; FFEL loans. FFEL includes four components: Stafford Loans, Unsubsidized Stafford Loans, Federal PLUS Loans, and Federal Consolidation Loans. Note: loans are no longer being made under this program. All new loans will be made under the Direct Loan program.
Part of what makes student loans so complex is the sheer number of options. And if you don’t know which one you’re choosing, you could end up with the wrong one for your financial situation. The Direct Loan, also known as a Federal Stafford Loan, is one of the most common federal student loans.
A Guide to Choosing Your Federal Stafford Loan. Stafford loans are low-interest loans that are offered by the government to help you pay for college. There are two types of federal Stafford Loans: Subsidized Stafford Loans and Unsubsidized Stafford Loans. Both types of loans offer fixed interest rates and allow up to 10 years to be paid back, but the Subsidized Stafford Loan has the best perks because it is offered to anyone who exhibits financial need.
Interest rate for loans made before July 1, 2006: For Stafford and Unsubsidized Stafford, in-school rate is 91-day T-Bill + 1.7%; in-repayment rate is 91-day T-Bill + 2.3%; both rates are capped at 8.25%. For PLUS, in-repayment rate is 91-day T-Bill + 3.1% and is capped at 9%. For Consolidation, see above.
Federal Family Education Loan Program. The Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program was the second largest of the U.S. higher education loan programs (Direct Loans being the first). The FFEL was initiated by the Higher Education Act of 1965 and was funded through a public/private partnership administered at the state and local level.
IT Band Causes. The most common cause of IT Band pain is a stress injury, the result of certain muscles surrounding the knee becoming neglected as others strengthen. IT Band injuries most commonly befall runners, and this type of injury is most likely to develop slowly over time.
The Myth of the “Tight IT Band”. Lateral leg pain may trigger other misguided diagnoses. The situation is equally confusing when the patient, perhaps in concert with a doctor or therapist, interprets their combination of poor adduction, tight hips and a sciatic distribution down the lateral leg as a “tight IT band” that requires stretching.
IT band syndrome is not an injury of inflammation (so icing won’t help) or tight musculature (so foam rolling the band itself or stretching won’t help). So, what does work? Let’s discuss the structure of the injury first to understand the true nature of IT band syndrome. RELATED: Injury Prevention 101: The IT Band.
Runners get their IT bands beat up because of the common feature of pronation following fatigue. This pronation causes tibial internal rotation, femoral adduction and internal rotation, and a stretching of the hip abductors, which increases the length and tension applied to the IT band and makes it stupidly unhappy.
Iliotibial Band (IT Band) Syndrome. IT Band Syndrome is the one of the most common overuse injuries for runners, triathletes, and cyclists. The IT Band is designed to assist the hip muscles in the outward movement of the thigh and to stabilize the side of the knee.
When pulled tight, this complex band of tissue can cause the spine, hip and knee to lose its natural alignment, and possibly cause some pain or problems with strength movements. The upper medial fibers also blend into the fibers of the thoracolumbar fascia, which means it has a role in low back structure too.
If that’s the case, you could have iliotibial band syndrome (ITBS) or IT band syndrome for short. IT band syndrome is an overuse injury that is common in endurance athletes like runners and bikers. It affects a tissue that runs from the side of your hip all of the way down past your knee.
The glute max particularly has some thick and dense connectivity to the IT band with its lateral fibers. Following the chain up, the fascia that connects through the glutes also crosses the SI joint and low back, making this line of tissue incredibly important for the overall function of the hip and low back.
What the IT Band Is. The iliotibial band (ITB) is a tendonous and fascial band that originates on the iliac crest (hipbone). It also attaches to the gluteal muscles (your rump) and the tensor fascia latae (TFL). The TFL is the muscle on the outside of your hip that moves your leg outward.
Icing the side of the knee. Stretching the IT band from the hip (the IT band has the consistency of a truck tire and is supposed to be tight) Foam rolling the IT band (ouch!) Complete rest.

―Peeta Mellark to Katniss Everdeen. Peeta Mellark, a baker's son from District 12, is one of the main characters of the The Hunger Games trilogy. He is a very compassionate person and is good with words. He has been in love with...
Peeta, with Haymitch and Cinna. When Peeta arrives in the Capitol, he is fixed up by his prep team, led by his stylist Portia. For the Parade, he and Katniss are dressed in black unitards with synthetic fire to represent burning coal.
The night before the Games, Peeta and Katniss talk on the rooftop about the horrors that await them in the arena. Peeta admits that he does not believe he has ever been a contender in the games; he merely wants to die as himself and show the Capitol that he is more than just a piece in their games.

Katniss believes that she has finally found the once-lost feeling Peeta stirs inside of her, that she needs Peeta to survive because he symbolizes hope and rebirth rather than destruction, like Gale does.
Knowing that to shoot him in the head would mean both his and Peeta's deaths, Katniss does not know what to do until Peeta shakily draws an X in blood on Cato's hands, signaling for Katniss to shoot him there, which she does. Cato falls to the mutts and later returns bloody and mangled, begging for Katniss to perform a mercy kill.
This warm loaf of bread from district 12 is a symbol of home and safety for Katniss. Later in the book it represents a memory of the woods and Gale for her. When Peeta is chosen as the boy tribute, a memory flashes into Katniss mind. When she was younger, there was a time when her family was close to starvation. It was shortly

Some of this calcium attaches to troponin which causes a change in the muscle cell that moves tropomyosin out of the way so the cross bridges can attach and produce muscle contraction. In summary the sliding filament theory of muscle contraction can be broken down into four distinct stages, these are; 1. Muscle activation: The motor nerve stimulates an action potential (impulse) to pass down a neuron to the neuromuscular junction.
The branching of glycogen is an important feature of the molecule metabolically as well. Since glycogen is broken down from the ends of the molecule, more branches translate to more ends, and more glucose that can be released at once. Liver and skeletal muscle are primary sites in the body where glycogen is found.
Some circumstances, however—such as evading the historical saber tooth tiger or lifting heavy weights—require energy production faster than our bodies can adequately deliver oxygen. In those cases, the working muscles generate energy anaerobically.

Cost Factors. When getting a cost quote for painting walls/masonry we suggest you make sure it includes all of the following: Scaffold/access requirements and separate cost for this. Minor cement repairs to render. Preparation work – rub down, moss/mould treatment, etc. Stabilizer. Good quality paint.
How to Prepare/Paint the Surface. Consider the following as a checklist for either yourself or your contractor: Scrape off any loose paint. Brush over wall to remove dust and cobwebs etc. Wash any excessive dirt etc off wall. Apply a moss killer (such as this product) to any mould/algae.
So, depending on the quality of paint you choose, it can cost as little as $300 or as much as $1,500 just for the paint on this size of home. Painting labor: This is the part of a house-painting job that carries the most weight on the price tag. Professional painters will typically charge $1,500-$3,000 to paint an average single-story home. However, if your home is up to 3,500 square feet with multiple levels, you can expect to pay $5,500 or more for exterior painting labor.
Without a doubt the best masonry paint is Dulux Weathershield (competitively priced on Amazon). The exterior of your house is not an area where you will want to use inferior paints, also bear in mind that the main cost involved in this work isn’t the paint itself, but the labour. We suggest you avoid cheap paints as it’s a false economy, you’ll only be repainting the whole area again in a few years time and that will cost you more in the long-term.
Since 2014 Quotation Check has been researching prices and charges for a wide range of home improvement projects. From wall rendering and decorating to plumbing and electrics. We are now one the most visited price checking websites in the UK. How much does it cost to paint an exterior wall? What are tradespeople charging for this type of work?
It can take twice as long to paint a pebble dash wall compared to a smooth surface; this is reflected in the price/cost of painting exterior pebble dash walls. Smooth surfaces are easy to paint as one can use a roller, which can cover a wide area very quickly. This also ensures the paint is applied evenly and efficiently – saving money.

The Presumption of Intoxication. Recently, I won a workers compensation jury trial on whether or not my client was intoxicated at the time of his injury. Intoxication cases are extremely difficult to win due to both the definition of intoxication and the way that the Division of Workers Compensation decides intoxication cases. There is a strong public policy in favor of maintaining a drug free workplace.
Drunk redirects here. For other uses, see Drunk (disambiguation). Alcohol intoxication (also known as drunkenness among other names) is a physiological state (that may also include psychological alterations of consciousness) induced by the ingestion of ethanol (alcohol).
Management of substance abuse. Acute intoxication. Definition. Intoxication is a condition that follows the administration of a psychoactive substance and results in disturbances in the level of consciousness, cognition, perception, judgement, affect, or behaviour, or other psychophysiological functions and responses.
Blood alcohol content. Blood alcohol content (BAC), also called blood alcohol concentration, blood ethanol concentration, or blood alcohol level, is most commonly used as a metric of alcohol intoxication for legal or medical purposes. Blood Alcohol Content is the legal name for BAC but Blood Alcohol Concentration is sometimes used for simpler description.
One-punch laws: Intoxication to be defined based on on high-range drink-driving levels. People will be presumed to be intoxicated under the government's proposed one-punch laws if they have blood-alcohol levels equivalent to those used to charge people with high-range drink-driving offences.
In most states, a BAC of .10% is considered legally drunk. This means that for every 1,000 milliliters of blood, the body contains 1 milliliter of alcohol. In some states, the legal definition of intoxication is .08%, which means that for every 1000 milliliters of blood, the body contains 8/10ths of a milliliter of alcohol. In addition, most states practice zero-tolerance laws, meaning if you are under 21 any alcohol in your system is against the law.
Lawyers said the eight-year minimum sentence was effectively a non-parole period, making the minimum sentence about 11 years, applying sentencing laws. The bill says there will be a ''conclusive presumption of intoxication'' with a blood-alcohol concentration of .15 or any level of drug concentration.
On Thursday Premier Barry O'Farrell introduced the Crimes and Other Legislation Amendment (Assault and Intoxication) Bill 2014, which says people will be presumed intoxicated if they register a blood-alcohol concentration level of .15 - three times the .05 level used to measure low-range drink-driving offences.
something that is presumed; an assumption. 5. a ground or reason for presuming or believing. 6. Law. an inference required or permitted by law as to the existence of one fact from proof of the existence of other facts. 7. an assumption, often not fully established, that is taken for granted in some piece of reasoning. 8. unwarrantable, unbecoming, or impertinent boldness. Origin of presumption.
Intoxication Law and Legal Definition. Intoxication is defined by state law, which varies by state, for purposes of defining drunk driving, driving while intoxicated, or driving under the influence laws. It is the condition of being drunk as the result of drinking alcoholic beverages and/or use of narcotics.
Baroid has engineered high-performance water-based fluids that emulate the performance of an invert emulsion fluid. Each fluid system is customized to address specific drilling challenges. Highly inhibitive products combat shale swelling and provide wellbore stability.
Shear stability is a measure of the amount of viscosity an oil may lose during operation. Oil experiences very high stresses in certain areas of the engine such as in the oil pump, cam shaft area , piston rings, and any other areas where two mating surface areas squeeze the oil film out momentarily .
This paper aims to model the shear thinning behavior of. heavy oil at a given temperature as frequency increases by. using the concept of activation energy of the Arrhenius. equation and liquid crystal theory. Laboratory. measurements of the viscoelastic properties of four heavy.
Shear thinning. Shear thinning is a phenomenon characteristic of some non-Newtonian fluids in which the fluid viscosity decreases with increasing shear stress. Shear thickening is the opposite phenomenon.
However, the minimum in viscosity occurs only at low shear stresses. At high stresses, the viscosity of the mixed emulsion increases as the proportion of fine droplets increases. The study of the aging effect on the rheological behavior shows that water-in-oil emulsions age much more rapidly than the oil-in-water emulsions.
Baroid’s SHALEDRIL™ water-based drilling fluid system is a family of cost effective, formation friendly, fresh-water based shale inhibiting fluids designed to meet various challenges in unconventional gas shale basins.
Baroid has engineered high-performance water-based fluids that emulate the performance of an invert emulsion fluid. Each fluid system is customized to address specific drilling challenges. Baroid’s inhibitive water-based systems help combat the swelling and fracturing of shale while drilling.
The shear stability of an oil is measured by using both ASTM test methods D445 and D5275. First, the viscosity of an engine oil is measured. Then, the oil is exposed to severe shearing conditions by repeatedly pumping it through a specially-sized diesel fuel injection nozzle at high pressure. After shearing the oil, its viscosity is measured again.
Results indicate that the droplet size has a dramatic influence on emulsion rheology. Fine emulsions (water-in-oil or oil-in-water) have much higher viscosities and storage moduli than the corresponding coarse emulsions. The shear-thinning effect is much stronger in the case of fine emulsions.
Shear thinning. Classification of fluids with shear stress as a function of shear rate: Pseudoplastic, Bingham and Bingham pseudoplastic all show reduction in apparent viscosity with increasing shear rate. In rheology, shear thinning is the non-Newtonian behavior of fluids whose viscosity decreases under shear strain. It is sometimes considered synonymous for pseudoplastic behaviour, and is usually defined as excluding time-dependent effects, such as thixotropy.
Numbness or tingling in the hands and/or feet (peripheral neuropathy) Neuropathy means that something is wrong with nerve tissue. Peripheral neuropathy refers more specifically to numbness in the fingers, hands, toes and feet. Although some people in lung cancer treatment never develop this condition, it is a fairly common occurrence. It may get better over time or the problem may continue after treatment.
Can numbness, tingling and weakness be symptoms of a nutritional deficiency? Yes. Although there are other possible causes of these symptoms such as multiple sclerosis, strokes and other brain or spinal cord problems, vitamine and mineral deficiencies can cause these symptoms.
When to see a doctor. It's important to determine the cause of hand numbness. If numbness persists or spreads to other parts of your body, consult your doctor for an evaluation. Treatment of numbness in your hands depends on the underlying cause. Begins suddenly, particularly if it's accompanied by weakness or paralysis, confusion, difficulty talking, dizziness, or a sudden, severe headache.
Over the weekend I was having tingling & numbness in my face, neck, arms and hands. Then all of a sudden I couldn't move my arms or fingers and had to call 911. I passed out about 3 times while the paramedics were helping me. Doctors at first thought it was a stroke but CT came back fine.

Dumping syndrome is a common side effect after Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RNYGB) surgery. About 85% of gastric bypass patients will experience dumping syndrome at some point after surgery. The symptoms can range from mild to severe. Dumping usually occurs due to poor food choices.
After several years of not getting enough vitamin B12 after a gastric bypass can result in visual changes, numbness and painful tingling and weakness of the legs and can cause anemia. Many people including women that are menstruating need to take supplemental Vitamin B12 in addition to the multivitamin each day.
If a gastric bypass patient does not take a daily multivitamin that contains vitamin B1, also called thiamine, a thiamine deficiency can occur resulting in confusion, unsteadiness and weakness numbness of the legs. This can occur after several weeks or a few months of not taking the vitamins.
Schedule an office visit if your numbness: 1  Begins or worsens gradually and persists. 2  Spreads to other parts of your body. 3  Affects both sides of your body.  Comes and 1  goes.

1 Smooth muscle or involuntary muscle is found within the walls of organs and structures such as the esophagus, stomach, intestines, bronchi, uterus, urethra, bladder, blood vessels, and the arrector pili in the skin (in which it controls erection of body hair).
Found only in the heart, cardiac muscle is an involuntary muscle responsible for pumping blood throughout the body, according to The Merck Manual. The heart's natural pacemaker is made of cardiac muscle that signals other cardiac muscles to contract.
Three types of muscle. You've got around 650 muscles in your body, and they make up roughly half of your bodyweight. These muscles can be divided into three different groups: skeletal, smooth and cardiac. All of these muscles can stretch and contract, but they perform very different functions. Skeletal muscle. The tissue most commonly thought of as muscle is skeletal muscle. Skeletal muscles cover your skeleton, giving your body its shape. They are attached to your skeleton by strong, springy tendons or are directly connected to rough patches of bone.
Overview. Although you have more than 600 muscles in your body, there are only three types of muscle: smooth, cardiac and skeletal. Each muscle helps to keep you in motion, your heart beating or signal a natural response in your body, such as the ability to keep your eyes focused.
Muscle tissues are derived from the mesodermal layer of embryonic germ cells in a process known as myogenesis. There are three types of muscle, skeletal or striated, cardiac, and smooth. Muscle action can be classified as being either voluntary or involuntary.
Smooth muscle is found in the walls of hollow organs like your intestines and stomach. They work automatically without you being aware of them. Smooth muscles are involved in many 'housekeeping' functions of the body. The muscular walls of your intestines contract to push food through your body.
Muscle is a soft tissue found in most animals. Muscle cells contain protein filaments of actin and myosin that slide past one another, producing a contraction that changes both the length and the shape of the cell. Muscles function to produce force and motion.
Three types of muscles. The muscular system can be broken down into three types of muscles: skeletal, smooth and cardiac, according to the NIH. Skeletal muscles are the only voluntary muscle tissue in the human body and control every action that a person consciously performs. Most skeletal muscles are attached to two bones across a joint, so the muscle serves to move parts of those bones closer to each other, according to The Merck Manual.
Instead, smooth muscles are controlled by involuntary responses in the brain and body. One example of smooth muscle is the digestive system, where muscles in the esophagus contract to move food down to the stomach and tighten when you have an illness that causes you to vomit.
Visceral, or smooth, muscle is found inside organs such as the stomach and intestines, as well as in blood vessels. It is called a smooth muscle because, unlike skeletal muscle, it does not have the banded appearance of skeletal or cardiac muscle.
Popular sovereignty is the belief that the state is created by the mandate of its people, who are the source of all political power. It is closely associated to the social contract philosophers, among whom are Thomas Hobbes, John Locke and Jean-Jacques Rousseau. The notion that power lies with the people.
Popular sovereignty expresses a concept and does not necessarily reflect or describe a political reality. It is usually contrasted with the concept of parliamentary sovereignty, and with individual sovereignty. The people have the final say in government decisions.
Popular sovereignty or the sovereignty of the people is the principle that the authority of a state and its government is created and sustained by the consent of its people, through their elected representatives (Rule by the People), who are the source of all political power.
The noun SOVEREIGNTY has 3 senses: 1. government free from external control. 2. royal authority; the dominion of a monarch. 3. the authority of a state to govern another state. Familiarity information: SOVEREIGNTY used as a noun is uncommon. Dictionary entry details.
Douglas applied popular sovereignty to Kansas in the Kansas Nebraska Act which passed Congress in 1854. The Act had two unexpected results. By dropping the Missouri Compromise of 1820 (which said slavery would never be allowed in Kansas), it was a major boost for the expansion of slavery.
Popular sovereignty indicates that the mandate of the people created government, and that political power comes from the people. However, in practice, political leaders abuse their power because they consider themselves sovereigns, instead of public servants.
In short, popular sovereignty covers a multitude of institutional possibilities. In each case, however, popular sovereignty assumes the existence of some form of popular consent, and it is for this reason that every definition of republican government implies a theory of consent. — Donald S. Lutz.

The pantheon of the Maya is a vast collection of deities who were worshipped throughout the region which, today, comprises Yucatan, Quintana Roo, Campeche, Tabasco, and Chiapas in Mexico and southward through Guatemala, Belize, El Salvador and Honduras.
There were over 250 deities in the pantheon of the Maya and, owing to the mass burning of their books by Bishop Diego de Landa in 1562, much information about the gods (and Maya culture) was irretrievably lost.
The Maya believed that he gave them the calendar and writing. It is thought that his name means lizard house. Kukulcan-Kukulkan was a powerful snake god whose name means feathered serpent. He was the primary god of the Itza people in the latter part of the Maya civilization.
Mayan Goddess. The ancient Maya had a complex pantheon of deities whom they worshipped and offered human sacrifices. Rulers were believed to be descendants of the Mayan gods and their blood was the ideal sacrifice, either through personal bloodletting or the sacrifice of captives of royal blood.
Itzamna-The most important Maya god was Itzamna. Itzamna was the god of fire who created the Earth. He was ruler of heaven as well as day and night. The Maya believed that he gave them the calendar and writing. It is thought that his name means lizard house.
He was the primary god of the Itza people in the latter part of the Maya civilization. He is often drawn to look like a dragon. Bolon Tzacab-Also known by the name Huracan (similar to our word for hurricane), Bolon Tzacab was the god of storms, wind, and fire.

Mayan religion was characterized by the worship of nature gods (especially the gods of sun, rain and corn), a priestly class, the importance of astronomy and astrology, rituals of human sacrifice, and the building of elaborate pyramidical temples.
This is a name list of Maya gods and supernatural beings playing a role in the Classic (200-900AD) and Post-Classic Maya religion. The names are mainly taken from the Books of Chilam Balam, Lacandon ethnography, the Madrid Codex, the work of Diego de Landa, and the Popol Vuh.

Diverticulitis occurs when a small pocket on the wall of the colon ruptures. If the hole seals quickly, one may be treated as an out-patient with oral antibiotics. Often, the inflammation is more severe, requiring IV antibiotics in the hospital.
Diverticulosis is the condition of having diverticula in the colon that are not inflamed. These are outpockets of the colonic mucosa and submucosa through weaknesses of muscle layers in the colon wall. They typically cause no symptoms. Diverticular disease occurs when diverticula become inflamed, known as diverticulitis, or bleed.
Tears in the colon leading to bleeding or perforations may occur; intestinal obstruction may occur (constipation or diarrhea does not rule this possibility out); and peritonitis, abscess formation, retroperitoneal fibrosis, sepsis, and fistula formation are also possible occurrences.
In fact, the pouches or bulges are rather common after age 40. However, on occasion, diverticula can become inflamed or infected, or they may tear. The inflammation can lead to a more chronic and serious condition known as diverticulitis. Once diverticulitis begins, it may cause serious health problems, including: nausea.
Diverticulitis is a serious medical condition that is characterized by inflamed pouches in the lining of your large intestine. These pouches are called diverticula. They develop when weak spots in the intestinal wall give way under pressure. This causes the intestine to protrude through the colonic wall structure.
In brief: Possibly. Diverticulitis is inflammation of the large bowel (also known as the colon). The inflammation results from simple infection to catastrophic perforation with leakage of contents into the abdomen. Most patients experience very minimal symptoms and are easily treated with antibiotics.
Diverticulosis and Diverticulitis. In diverticulosis, small pouches develop and bulge out through weak spots in the walls of the colon, typically in the part of the colon called the sigmoid colon on the left side of the abdomen. These small, balloonlike pouches are called diverticula.
It is defined as diverticular disease with signs and symptoms of diverticular inflammation. Clinical features of acute diverticulitis include constant abdominal pain, localized abdominal tenderness in the left lower quadrant of the abdomen, nausea, vomiting, constipation or diarrhea, fever and leucocytosis.
If the pouches become inflamed or infected, you have a condition called diverticulitis. The most common symptom is abdominal pain, usually on the left side. You may also have fever, nausea, vomiting, chills, cramping, and constipation. In serious cases, diverticulitis can lead to bleeding, tears, or blockages. Your doctor will do a physical exam and imaging tests to diagnose it. Treatment may include antibiotics, pain relievers, and a liquid diet.
It is equally common in women and men. If the diverticula become inflamed or infected, the condition is called diverticulitis. Diverticulitis can lead to serious complications such as abscess, perforation, intestinal blockage from internal scarring, or fistula, which is an abnormal connection between two organs.

A point source is a single, identifiable source of pollution (Wikipedia), such as a pipe or a drain. Industrial wastes are commonly discharged to rivers and the sea in this way.
SI – Confirm/refute presence of HFM. Investigate HFM as an AOC in RI. RI – To characterize HFM, i nstall at least four borings, test pits or trenches per acre with a minimum of four locations per site, regardless of size. – Establish horizontal extent of HFM by installing a minimum of four borings /test pits/trenches in non-fill areas.
10Definition of Historic Definition of Fill material What it isn’t • Any material which is substantially chromate chemical production waste • Chemical production waste • Waste from processing of metal or mineral ores, residues, slag or tailings • A municipal solid waste landfill site.
Non-point source pollution can be contrasted with point source pollution, where discharges occur to a body of water or into the atmosphere at a single location.
RA – Provide results and/or describe nature of fill in Deed Notice, soil remediation permit, eng, controls and establish CEA and Financial Assurance if needed. The delineation can be used to reduce the extent of an engineering control (if needed) and amount established for the FA. III.
Non-point source (NPS) pollution refers to both water and air pollution from diffuse sources. Non-point source water pollution affects a water body from sources such as polluted runoff from agricultural areas draining into a river, or wind-borne debris blowing out to sea. Non-point source air pollution affects air quality from sources such as smokestacks or car tailpipes.
Nonpoint sources. Non-point sources of pollution are often termed ‘diffuse’ pollution and refer to those inputs and impacts which occur over a wide area and are not easily attributed to a single source. They are often associated with particular land uses, as opposed to individual point source discharges.
Forestry operations may contribute to non-point source pollution of streams by increasing soil erosion and sediment run-off. Non-point source pollution is often more difficult to control than point source pollution.
30 Remedial Action-Requirements For a non-residential site-contamination between residential and non-residential SRS• Deed Notice is required (engineering control is notrequired) • Soil Remediation Permit is required • Biennial Certifications are required• Financial Assurance is not required.
Non point source water pollution is difficult to control because it comes from the everyday activities of many different people, such as fertilizing a lawn, using a pesticide, or constructing a road or building.

Although it is possible that reduction in size of the Tnaive and TCM CD8 subsets in cGVHD might be the consequence of the reduced production of naive recent thymic T-cell emigrants and/or impaired survival in the periphery, the mechanisms leading to the increase of CD8 TEMRA cells are unknown.
Ten of them had cGVHD and 10 patients had no current cGVHD (>100 days after transplantation). In the group of patients with cGVHD, three had extensive and seven limited disease. A great proportion of patients with cGVHD required immunosoppressive treatment at the time of sampling.
Comparatively little is known about the role of CD8 T cells in cGVHD and whether, similarly to CD4 T cells, it is associated with the preponderance of a particular CD8 T-cell subset.

Edie fills her tarts with either Bavarian cream - a combination of custard powder blended with milk, vanilla and a small amount of nondairy whipped topping folded into heavy whipped cream - or a cooked, cooled custard (a basic pastry cream) with some whipped cream folded in.
Associated with the Northumberland village of the same name, this very local recipe which uses custard powder alongside plain flour and icing sugar was probably discovered by accident.
Increasingly his baking and custard powder were sold nationally and then in 1855, this entrepreneurial chemist decided to take a big jump. Beat the butter until soft, then sift the icing sugar, custard powder and malted drink powder into the bowl and beat again.
You can find custard powder at some specialty markets and some markets that specialize in imports from other countries. If you’re traveling abroad, you should be able to find it pretty easily. Birds’s is a big name in custard powder, but even Pillsbury produces it for other markets.
Use custard powder to make custard by mixing it with boiling milk or cream and sugar to taste. Use it to make a custard sauce by mixing it with hot milk and seasonings such as herbs and spices as desired. Custard powder is different than instant custard, which is typically prepared by adding water.
Custard powder is predominantly used in Britain as an alternative to using eggs for making custard. It was invented in the 1830s by Alfred Bird, whose wife enjoyed custard but was allergic to eggs. He named the product Bird's, which remains a widely used brand in the United Kingdom.
Put the flour, custard powder, malted drink powder and icing sugar in food processor and pulse. Fun to make, bake and eat; The Great British Bake Off is back and former contestant Cathryn Dresser is showing kids how to get creative in the kitchen.
Mix the custard powder with water and add to the sauce at the last minute. The shopping list, drawn up by Sven Goran Eriksson's squad, also includes large amounts of baked beans, rice pudding, tomato soup - and even custard powder.
What ingredients make up custard powder? A: Custard powder is predominantly made of a starch, such as tapioca or cornstarch, along with flavoring such as vanilla, salt and annatto for color. The powder is colored and flavored so that it gains the look and flavor of custard once it is mixed with hot milk.
I used some recently in my recipe for Vanilla Slices. Custard powder is not dried, powdered custard. It is actually a powdered mix used to make custard, and it is very similar to the type of mix used to make instant pudding in the US. Just combine it with milk, cook to thicken, and you have custard (or pudding)! Custard powder is primarily made up of thickeners that give the pudding its texture. Cornstarch is usally the biggest component, since it is great for thickening liquids, disolves easily and is almost foolproof.
If possible, it would be in your best interest to wait until age 59.5 or older to withdraw funds from your 401K. This way you will only owe tax on the money, and can avoid a 10 percent penalty. Always remember: the money you put into your 401K is not taxed. But you will pay taxes when you withdraw the funds.
As you know, there are many tax benefits of contributing to a 401K. With this in mind, you should also know how the withdrawal process works, when you can get your money, penalties that may arise, and how to pay back the IRS if you find that you owe more in taxes than you can handle.
401k and IRAs are Assets, the IRS can levy assets and seize them if you do not resolve your tax matters. You can resolve your back taxes through different avenues, negotiated payment plans and negotiated tax settlements.
The IRS does include an exception to the 10 percent additional tax penalty if the distribution is made because of an IRS levy on the plan. The levy must be on the specific 401(k) plan; it cannot be a general levy on your assets. For example, maybe you owe $5,000 in back taxes and your car is levied upon by the IRS.
Setting up an installment agreement with the IRS is a simple process. If possible, it would be in your best interest to wait until age 59.5 or older to withdraw funds from your 401K. This way you will only owe tax on the money, and can avoid a 10 percent penalty.
If you voluntarily withdraw money from your 401(k) to repay the IRS, the amount removed is subject to a 10 percent IRS early withdrawal penalty, but you might be able to avoid this problem by taking a hardship distribution. Talk this option over with your tax adviser before proceeding.
A 401(k) plan is a retirement account managed for your benefit by a professional management firm selected by your employer. These accounts vary widely in their details. While the Internal Revenue Service can, and does, levy against 401(k)s and other retirement accounts, you can find ways to avoid it.
This establishes the fact that the IRS is owed money. The IRS then issues a notice of intent to levy and finally a notice of levy on the 401k plan. The IRS will collect any and all funds from your 401k plan in order to satisfy a tax debt you owe.
If you voluntarily withdraw money from your 401(k) to repay the IRS, the amount removed is subject to a 10 percent IRS early withdrawal penalty, but you might be able to avoid this problem by taking a hardship distribution.
Process. The IRS normally places a federal tax lien on your 401k prior to taking any further action. This establishes the fact that the IRS is owed money. The IRS then issues a notice of intent to levy and finally a notice of levy on the 401k plan.

Pipelines are generally buried and therefore the outside pipe surface is not available for visual. inspection. To overcome this restriction, tools have been developed to inspect the pipe wall. thickness, position, and geometry from inside the pipeline, hence the reference to in-line. inspection (ILI).
The significant point is that a major cause of loss of integrity is due to the presence of an. anomaly that is present in the pipe and not the age of the pipe. As will be discussed later, age. helps to determine the types of anomolies that are potentially of concern in a pipeline.
Pipelines are an important part of the infrastructure that supplies the energy needs of business. and the public. Liquid pipelines transport fuel that is used to power automobiles, buses, trucks. and airplanes. Natural gas pipelines transport natural gas, propane, and other gases used for.

But that wouldn’t be true. Johnson was a man of his time, and bore those flaws as surely as he sought to lead the country past them. For two decades in Congress he was a reliable member of the Southern bloc, helping to stonewall civil rights legislation.
Johnson was a Democrat from Texas, who served as a United States Representative from 1937 to 1949 and as a United States Senator from 1949 to 1961. He spent six years as Senate Majority Leader, two as Senate Minority Leader, and two as Senate Majority Whip.
Lyndon Johnson was a civil rights hero. But also a racist. Editor’s note: Readers may find some language included to be offensive. Lyndon Johnson said the word “nigger” a lot. In Senate cloakrooms and staff meetings, Johnson was practically a connoisseur of the word. According to Johnson biographer Robert Caro, Johnson would calibrate his pronunciations by region, using “nigra” with some southern legislators and “negra” with others.
Lyndon Johnson succeeded John F Kennedy as president. Johnson was encouraged by his advisors to take up a more forceful approach to the Vietnam conflict and to send in US troops to bolster the South Vietnam Army. The new leader of South Vietnam was General Khanh and he made it clear to Johnson that he did not believe that the South Vietnamese Army could withstand the NLF. Initially Johnson was not keen to send in troops to South Vietnam.
Lyndon Baines Johnson was born on August 27, 1908, in Stonewall, Texas, in a small farmhouse on the Pedernales River, the oldest of five children born to Samuel Ealy Johnson Jr. (1877–1937) and Rebekah Baines (1881–1958).
Johnson ran for the Democratic nomination in the 1960 presidential election. Although unsuccessful, he was chosen by Senator John F. Kennedy of Massachusetts to be his running mate. They went on to win a close election over Richard Nixon and Henry Cabot Lodge. Johnson was sworn in as Vice President on January 20, 1961. Two years and ten months later, on November 22, 1963, Johnson succeeded Kennedy as President following the latter's assassination. He ran for a full term in the 1964 election, winning by a landslide over Republican opponent Arizona Senator Barry Goldwater.
16 Aug 2016. Lyndon Johnson succeeded John F Kennedy as president. Like many ‘hawks’ in the White House, Johnson was a fervent supporter of the ‘Domino Theory’ and he was keen to support South Vietnam against the NLF:
After Johnson’s death, Parker would reflect on the Johnson who championed the landmark civil rights bills that formally ended American apartheid, and write, “I loved that Lyndon Johnson.” Then he remembered the president who called him a nigger, and he wrote, “I hated that Lyndon Johnson.”. That sounds about right.
Lyndon Johnson's Daily Diary. Lyndon Johnson’s secretaries began compiling the Daily Diary in 1959, when he was the Senate Majority Leader. As meetings and telephone calls occurred, the secretary “working” the Diary would note them.
Home » Exhibits » The Vietnam Conflict. The war in Vietnam began long before Lyndon Johnson's Presidency and ended in 1975, years after he left office. But for many Americans, it is the event most closely associated with Johnson's years in the White House. Of the millions of files, thousands of photos and recordings, and hundreds of films housed in our library, a substantial number relate to America's presence in Vietnam.
So 550 BC means 550 years before Jesus was born. And 2000 AD almost means 2000 years after Jesus was born ... ... except AD started at 1, not 0. So, 2 AD is actually 1 Year after Jesus was born. And 2000 AD is actually 1999 Years after Jesus was born.nd if you continue counting years from then you get our current year number. So, AD is now just a Year Number (every New Year we add 1), and it only roughly equals how many years ago that Jesus Christ was born.
But we don't really know WHEN Jesus was born! Some historians put the actual birth of Jesus 4 years earlier (4 BC), but it WAS thought to be exactly at 1 AD. A monk named Dionysius Exiguus calculated his own present year to be 525 AD.And if you continue counting years from then you get our current year number.So, AD is now just a Year Number (every New Year we add 1), and it only roughly equals how many years ago that Jesus Christ was born.nd if you continue counting years from then you get our current year number.

Yogurt. Dairy products are a good protein source, with one cup of nonfat yogurt containing 13 grams of protein. The same amount of low-fat yogurt has less, just 11.9 grams, but more than one cup of skim milk, which has 8.4 grams of protein.
The top five protein-rich foods include seafood and poultry. Seafood is generally a good source of protein. Of the 22 varieties listed on the U.S. Food and Drug Administration food chart for cooked seafood, only the oyster had less than 15 grams of protein per 3-ounce serving. 1. Turkey.
The term “complete protein” refers to foods that have all nine essential amino acids present in the correct proportion for our bodies to build protein with. The term “incomplete protein” refers to foods which have all the essential amino acids, but are simply low in one or more of them.
Oats have gotten a bad rap over the years as a breakfast moosh fit for little orphan Oliver or old school prison inmates, but truly they are a food fit for kings.

I hope not! I'm a guy and sometimes my stomach is bloated and hurts. If that meant I'm pregnant I'd really doubt my gender.
Along with feeling full, gassy and having pain in your abdomen, you should check if your bloated stomach occurs simultaneously with other symptoms throughout the body. This can clue you in on what’s causing the problem and whether it might be serious enough to warrant a doctor’s visit.
Some of the best foods for helping to battle stomach bloating include (8): 1  Probiotics: “Good bacteria” called probiotics act like friendly gut bugs in your digestive tract, killing off bad bacteria that can trigger digestive issues and reactions.
It can certainly help you to track your symptoms after eating certain foods known to cause bloating, but remember that bloating is caused by your entire lifestyle, not just the food on your plate. Some of the best foods for helping to battle stomach bloating include:
Symptoms of a Bloated Stomach. Having a bloated stomach is different from gaining actual fat mass around your stomach, since bloating is temporary and mostly caused by air becoming stuck around your abdomen, making it distend outward.
4. Constipation. This might be the most obvious reason you have a bloated stomach — you need to go to the bathroom! Constipation can cause stool to remain in the intestines, leaving you with a hard-feeling stomach, pain, discomfort and gas.
When you’re feeling bloated, check for other symptoms, including: A fever. Skin rashes or hives. Watery eyes, itchy throat and other signs of allergic reaction. Constipation or diarrhea. Vomiting or nausea. Blood in your urine or stool. Unintentional weight loss.
No, that means you ate something that didn't agree with you. If being bloated and having a stomach ache makes you pregnant I had my first pregnancy when I was 3 0
When you’re feeling bloated, check for other symptoms, including: 1  A fever. 2  Skin rashes or hives. 3  Watery eyes, itchy throat and other signs of allergic reaction. 4  Constipation or diarrhea. 5  Vomiting or nausea. 6  Blood in your urine or stool. 7  Unintentional weight loss. 8  Trouble going to the bathroom.
Sometimes a severely bloated stomach (though it isn’t actually your stomach that’s bloated)— along with constipation, nausea and vomiting — is due to a bowel obstruction, which can be caused by scar tissue or a tumor in either the small intestine or the colon, among other causes.

TTP (thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura): A life-threatening disease involving embolism and thrombosis (plugging) of the small blood vessels in the brain. It is usually caused by inhibition of an enzyme called ADAMTS13 which normally serves to break up a blood protein called Von Willebrand Factor into smaller pieces.
It occurs at a rate of 3.7 cases per year per million persons. Plasma exchange (running blood through a machine to which patient is connected to remove the plasma-or fluid portion of the blood and returning it mixed with fresh plasma from donors and other fluids) has greatly reduced the death rate in this disorder.
thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. A rare, life-threatening disease marked by widespread aggregation of platelets throughout the body, neurological dysfunction, and renal insufficiency. The disease is triggered by a deficiency of an enzyme that cleaves von Willebrand factor (a blood clotting protein). This deficiency results in blood clots in small blood vessels throughout the body.
The mortality (death) rate for promptly treated cases ranges from 10 to 20 percent as compared to 90% before plasma exchange was used. Many drugs have been associated with TTP. One is the antiplatelet drug clopidogrel (Plavix).

Certified Humane Raised and Handled is a certification and labeling program that is the only animal welfare label requiring the humane treatment of farm animals from birth through slaughter.
WHAT THIS LABEL MEANS: The Certified Humane label means that the farms raising the animals for meat, eggs or dairy met the Humane Farm Animal Care program’s standards that aim to improve humane living conditions and humane treatment during transportation and slaughter.
If the carton says “certified humane” it means the birds were raised in a manner that meets certification requirements of Humane Farm Animal Care. Laying hens must be uncaged and have access to perches, nest boxes and dust-bathing areas.
If the carton says “certified humane” it means the birds were raised in a manner that meets certification requirements of Humane Farm Animal Care. Laying hens must be uncaged and have access to perches, nest boxes and dust-bathing areas. Flock density is limited but birds are not required to have access to the outdoors.
When you see the Certified Humane Raised and Handled ® label on a product you can be assured that the food products have come from facilities that meet precise, objective standards for farm animal treatment.
The truth behind what “cage-free,” “free-range” and other common terms mean (and don’t mean) for animal welfare. Many farmers raise chickens in battery cages that restrict the birds' movements, leaving them no room to spread their wings or even turn around.
You have the power to make a difference in the lives of farm animals. Take action for farm animals today by: 1  Insisting only on Certified Humane ® products in grocery stores and restaurants. 2  Find where to buy products. 3  Pledge your voice to our monthly action.
The Certified Humane ® program is the best way for you to position meat, poultry, egg and dairy products to tap the growing demand for humanely raised products. When you become certified, you get credibility from inspection by the independent nonprofit Humane Farm Animal Care.

For example: If you have an internet connection with a consistent 1 megabit per second speed, it will only be able to download a 1/8 Megabytes every second. So if you are downloading a 10 Megabyte file through the said connection, it would take 80 seconds to the download that file and not just 10.

Megabit = Mb; MBps = Mega Bytes per second; Mbps = Mega bits per second; 1 Megabyte = 8 Megabit. 1 Megabyte = 1024 Kilobyte (KB) 8 Megabit = 1024 Kilobyte. Therefore, 1 Megabit (Mb) = [1024/8 =] 128 Kilobyte (KB) So, it should be noted that you need to convert between Megabytes and Megabits if you are looking into how long a file will be downloaded.
Bytes are represented with a capital B, and bits are represented with a Lower case b: 1  Megabyte = MB. 2  Megabit = Mb. 3  MBps = Mega Bytes per second. 4  Mbps = Mega bits per second.
Understand your Internet Speeds – Megabits vs. Megabytes. One thing that often gives people confusion is the difference between a Megabyte (MB) and a Megabit (Mb). People often assume that a download speed of 1 Megabit per second (1 Mbps) will allow them to download a 1 Megabyte (MBps) file in one second. This is not the case. Internet speed is measured in bits: bits, kilobits, megabits.
Fresh aronia berries are commonly used to make juice, jam, syrup, and wine. Dried aronia berries, which are available in many health food stores, can be eaten as a healthy snack, added to muesli, or used in muffins and other baked goodies.
The species Aronia melanocarpa is native to the northeastern quarter of the United States and southeastern Canada. Its native range extends west to Wisconsin, Iowa, Missouri, and Arkansas. It is on state endangered species lists in Iowa and Missouri.
As research is constantly being conducted, there’s a lot more about the aronia berry which is being uncovered. Here’s a look at how exactly the aronia berry can be helpful to us. Circulation. Aronia berries are known to improve the circulation of blood, make blood vessels stronger and fight against heart disease.
The juice contains high levels of. anthocyanins (source of red color) and flavonoids. The strong, stable natural color is useful in the food. industry. This plant is extensively grown in Europe, where yields of up to 38 pounds of fruit per bush.
General: A member of the Rose family, black. chokeberry is a deciduous shrub which can grow to a. height of 3 to 6 feet tall. The fine-toothed leaves are. medium green and hairless, with raised glands along. the top of the midrib. In spring, the white bisexual. flowers form clusters that are 2 to 2 ½ inches across.
What is Aronia Melanocarpa. Aronia melanocarpa is currently being touted in research studies as a berry with a high concentration of flavonoids and antioxidants recognized for medicinal benefits. This bountiful shrub was known to Native Americans for healing qualities.
The Aronia Berry – An Antioxidant Superstar. The superfood status Aronia melanocarpa has earned is largely attributable to its very strong antioxidant properties. In fact, aronia berries have the highest antioxidant capacity among berries and other fruits evaluated to date (as of 2012).
There’s been a huge revival of interest in the aronia berry in recent times, especially since its numerous benefits have come to light. Often referred to as chokeberry, this dark berry is native to North America. It was part of the staple diet of Native Americans and early settlers because it was so chockfull of health.
What is aronia? Aronia melanocarpa is a perennial, deciduous shrub, native to the eastern half of the United States. Its native range extends north into Canada and south into Georgia, and includes only Winneshiek County in Iowa. Aronia is cold hardy to at least USDA Zone 3 (-40 degrees Fahrenheit).
Aronia (pronounced ar-ROH-nee-uh) is one of the common names used for Aronia melanocarpa. It is a perennial, deciduous, self-supporting shrub. Unlike grape vines, aronia does not need trellising. The growth habit of Aronia melanocarpa plants varies greatly. The range of variability extends from ground cover types to tall and leggy shrubs up to 20 feet tall and everything in-between.
We hear it as the change in pitch of a train's horn as it passes us, says Watson. In light waves, it causes things moving towards you to shift to shorter wavelengths at the blue end of the spectrum. And objects moving away from you shift to longer frequencies, at the red end of the spectrum.. Astronomers used the Doppler effect to find the new solar system, says Watson.
2. Be able to find the volume of an object or substance using the correct equipment and technique. This tutorial will enable you to find the volume of any substance whether it is liquid, solid, regular in shape, or irregularly shaped.
To find the volume of a solid that does not have a regular shape requires a procedure called water displacement. When an object is added to the water in a graduated cylinder, the level of the water rises. This happens because the object pushes water out of the way and displaces it with its own volume.
Because gravity varies by over 0.5% over the surface of the earth, the distinction between force due to gravity and mass is relevant for accurate calibration of scales for commercial purposes. Usually the goal is to measure the mass of the sample rather than its force due to gravity at that particular location.
Some of the sources of error in weighing are: 1  Buoyancy – Objects in air develop a buoyancy force that is directly proportional to the volume of air displaced. 2  Error in mass of reference weight. 3  Air gusts, even small ones, which push the scale up or down.
What do we use to measure mass? The difference between mass and weight causes a lot of confusion amongst a lot of people. Put simply, weight is a measure of gravity's effect on something. Mass is the amount of matter in an object. Move to a different planet and an object's weight will change, but its mass will be the same. There are a couple of ways to measure mass. The most common method is to use a balance. Hey, wait a minute! (you should be saying) People weigh stuff all the time with a balance!
Specifically, we will review the metric system so that you will be. able to measure length, mass, volume and temperature in metric units, and convert between the. English and metric systems. You will also familiarize yourself with common laboratory. equipment. You will review and practice scientific notation so that you will understand its use in. scientific measurement.
Just recently, astronomers discovered a distant solar system, 127 light years away with up to seven planets orbiting a Sun-like star called HD 10180. Like the very first exoplanet 51-Pegusus discovered in 1995, this new system was found using the science of spectroscopy.
Quick Answer. The instruments used to measure the mass of an object are scales and balances. Several different types of scales and balances exist and are used based on the type of measurement needed. Continue Reading.
Concept Mastery Material: Matter is defined as anything that has mass and takes up space which means has volume. The Liter (L) is the SI unit for volume. Usually, small volumes of liquid are given in milliliters (mL). Remember that 1 L equals 1,000 mL.
The rabies incubation period may vary from a few days to several years, but is typically one to three months.During this time, the rabies virus is multiplying within the body. At some point, the rabies virus will travel along nerve cells to the brain.ventually, the virus cause rabies symptoms to develop. The period from the time from infection to the onset of symptoms is known as the rabies incubation period.
1 The incubation period -- the period of time between exposure to a disease and the onset of clinical signs -- for rabies can vary greatly.2  The typical incubation period is three to eight weeks, but it can be as little as nine days or as long as several years in some rare cases. The incubation period -- the period of time between exposure to a disease and the onset of clinical signs -- for rabies can vary greatly.
In people, the incubation period (the time between initial contact with the virus and onset of the disease) generally ranges from two to eight weeks. In rare cases, it can vary from 10 days to 2 years.The incubation period is shorter in children and in people exposed to a large dose of the rabies virus.The dose of virus depends on the size, severity and location of an animal bite or scratch. In animals, the incubation period depends on the species of animal.n people, the incubation period (the time between initial contact with the virus and onset of the disease) generally ranges from two to eight weeks. In rare cases, it can vary from 10 days to 2 years.
It multiplies in the brain very quickly, causing the end of the rabies incubation period, and the beginning of rabies symptoms. Usually within three to five days, the rabies virus has caused enough damage to the brain that the animal will begin to show unmistakable signs of rabies.ventually, the virus cause rabies symptoms to develop. The period from the time from infection to the onset of symptoms is known as the rabies incubation period.
The initial symptoms of rabies are mild, but they quickly become serious. The incubation period is the time it takes for symptoms to develop after a person is infected with the virus.The incubation period for rabies is usually two to 12 weeks, although it can be as short as four days.

How long and at what temperature should I cook a beef roast in the oven? Roasting is a great cooking method for a large, tender cut of beef  such as a rib or sirloin roast.Sirloin-tip, rump, rolled-rump, eye-of-round or top-round roasts will also benefit from this cooking method if they are graded prime or choice. sirloin roast of 8- to 12-lbs will take 16-20 minutes for rare, 20-22 for medium rare, 23-25 for medium, and 26-30 for well done. A boneless top round, by contrast, will take 28-30 minutes for rare, 30-33 for medium rare, 34-38 for medium, and 40-45 for well done.
4) Place the beef in a roasting pan, and put it in the oven, uncovered. Timing is Everything. 1) Cook the roast for 15 minutes at 500 degrees F. 2) After 15 minutes, turn the temperature down to 375 degrees F.3) Continue cooking for 16 minutes per pound (ex: If your roast is 3 pounds, that would be 48 minutes). 4) Remove from oven, and place pan on a cooling rack.iming is Everything. 1) Cook the roast for 15 minutes at 500 degrees F. 2) After 15 minutes, turn the temperature down to 375 degrees F. 3) Continue cooking for 16 minutes per pound (ex: If your roast is 3 pounds, that would be 48 minutes).

The oven temperature used to cook a beef roast is usually set somewhere between 300 degrees and 450 degrees Fahrenheit. The recommended cooking temperature for your roast is usually determined by the type of beef cut that you plan to roast.he proper beef roast cook times and the correct beef cooking oven temperatures are extremely important. The optimum flavor and tenderness of various beef roasts can be consistently achieved when care is taken to follow the recommended time and temperature guidelines for cooking beef roasts.
Roasting tips. 1  Take the roast from the fridge about 15-20 minutes before cooking. 2  This will take the chill out of the meat and allow it to cook more evenly. 3  If you like rare or medium rare meat, and the roast is without a bone it’s a good idea to do this.oasting tips. 1  Take the roast from the fridge about 15-20 minutes before cooking. 2  This will take the chill out of the meat and allow it to cook more evenly. 3  If you like rare or medium rare meat, and the roast is without a bone it’s a good idea to do this.

As it turned out, the rumor was partially true: While Fireball whisky wasn't being broadly recalled, it was the subject of recent scrutiny and a partial recall in Finland and Sweden due to the product's inclusion of propylene glycol.
Firstly, just to get it out of the way, scotch (as mentioned in the question details) is by definition, not whiskey. It isn't only a matter of spelling, there is a distinct difference between how each product is made.
Well, I&#39;ve tried many different liquors.. Vodka, Gin, Rum, etc.. But I&#39;ve always liked Fireball, and I&#39;ve always drank it straight; I don&#39;t mind the taste, but I&#39;d rather be mixing it. Just curious as to what some other people like to drink with Fireball, or if they could...
So, with that aside, what about the brand in the question, the quaintly named Fireball Whiskey? Their website [2] is too far up its own fundament to be of any use so we must seek other sources of information. First warning sign: it appears to be a mere 33% alcohol* [3]. This will certainly make you unfit to drive or operate heavy machinery, but is closer to what we give small children to drink in Ireland than it is to true whiskey (40% and up).
Fireball whisky is a popular choice among the college set due to its low cost and relatively high alcohol content, with sales rivaling the collegiate staple of Jägermeister in recent years, and so rumors suggesting that a Fireball recall was underway sent ripples of upset across social sites.
Vodka, Gin, Rum, etc.. But I've always liked Fireball, and I've always drank it straight; I don't mind the taste, but I'd rather be mixing it. Just curious as to what some other people like to drink with Fireball, or if they could suggest something else to drink. 2 following.

So....in this country Fireball is classifiied as a flavored whisky, not a liqueur and hence can be called Cinnamon Whisky. Outside of the USA it is a liqueur blended with cinnamon and whisky. So technically in the USA it is a whisky but not the rest of the world.
Good PSAT Scores for Sophomores Average scores (scores in the 50th percentile) are around 42 in each section, or about 126 total. A good score would be higher than average. This chart shows estimates for the minimum section and composite scores you would need to make it in the 70th, 80th, 90th, and 99th percentiles.
Each section of the PSAT is scored on a scale of 20 to 80; SAT sections are scored from 200 to 800. By adding a zero to your PSAT scores, you can estimate your SAT results. Unlike many tests, there is no passing or failing score on the PSAT / SAT.
PSAT scores will arrive for anxious high school students this week. These scores mark the time when sophomores and juniors can begin to target colleges that are in range. Realistically, there are only 5 months left for juniors to visit colleges before campuses empty out in the first week of May.
The Preliminary Scholastic Aptitude Test (PSAT) is generally taken in the sophomore year of high school. It is a good indicator of how a student will do on the SAT exams and can help student pinpoint areas of weakness to study before taking the SAT.
A PSAT score report contains a separate score for each of the three section types (Critical Reading, Math, and Writing Skills) on a scale from 20 to 80. The score report also contains the test-taker’s Selection Index, which is the sum of the scaled scores for each of the three section types.

Unlike many tests, there is no passing or failing score on the PSAT / SAT. A “good” score depends on two factors: 1  Your past performance.
So you've taken the PSAT, but your PSAT score has you worried. You have no idea if it's good or not or how it even relates to the SAT. So here is some basic info about that illustrious PSAT score. You'll get three scores on your PSAT score report, one for each section – Critical Reading, Math and Writing.

Math Section. Scores on the math section range from 20 to 80 points. This corresponds to the 200- to 800-point range on the SAT. The average score is between 44 and 49. To qualify to apply for a National Merit Scholarship, you must score 65 or above.
Also listed on your PSAT score report is your Selection Index (SI). This score is the sum of all three PSAT sections. So for instance if your scores were the same as the average 11th grade PSAT scores for 2014, your SI would be a 140.8.
DIY Battery Reconditioning Guide. If you want to learn more on how to recondition a battery, you can check out the Reconditioning Battery guide by Les Oke. Les and his family have been living off the power grid for more than 15 years. To commute, the whole family use a pure electric car.
This video exposes the secret of restoring a sealed lead acid battery. Battery manufacturers certainly don't want you to know this because it can stop them from taking your money. 1  People & Blogs.
The laptop is about 3.5 years old or thereabouts. I never really used it on the battery much except just to move it from here to there or in case of a power out. So the battery never got much use. But it was always plugged in. But now I find that it only powers the laptop for about 10 minutes before is warns that it is low, then shuts me down. This is supposed to be a 2.5 or 3 hour battery. Plus it's a Lithiom ion and those are not supposed to have the memory effect like nickel metal hydrid or whatever.
Everything. In this case I used an AC/DC adaptor to give a 4.8V 150mAh NiMH battery made for a Losi Micro T/B/DT Remote Control Car a Voltage Blast. It works almost like a defibrillator on a heart shocking the battery back to life. This poor video quality comes from the front facing camera on an iPad 2.
Instructions. Open your hood, propping it carefully. Have your partner pull his car face-to-face with your car or next to the battery side of your vehicle. Be sure that the cars are not touching. Open the hood of the other vehicle. Turn both vehicles off. Attach one cable to the positive terminal of the partner car. Attach the other end to the positive terminal of the dead battery.
2 thoughts on “ Battery Reconditioning – How To Bring Dead Car Batteries To Life ”. Pingback: How DIY Electric Car Works | Build Electric Car | Electric Car Conversion Blog By Electric Car Conversion Enthusiast Will Yap. A car that won’t start usually points to one thing a dead battery.
When formed, the lead sulfate are very fine and can be converted back to lead. Over time, the converted lead will coat the battery’s plates therefore less surface contact with the electrolyte. This process is known as sulfation. To recondition a car battery, we have to find a way to get rid of the sulfation. When the sulfate is removed, the battery will regain its ability to hold electric charge. One way of doing so is building a small musical instrument that resonates a sound inside the battery.
Drive or idle the car for 20 to 30 minutes to allow the alternator to recharge the battery. If your battery is more than three years old, it may be at the end of its life and in need of replacement.
If you are wandering how to recondition battery at home, maybe this blog post will be able to help you. The process of reconditioning old batteries and bring them to life is not that difficult. What you will need is the right information and the right tools.
Problem: The battery in my R/C car wouldn't charge. This can happen sometimes when NiMH and NiCad batteries go without use for long periods of time. Solution: Voltage Blast! Please use caution as batteries can SPLODE! Also, I have no idea if this works on lithium type batteries.

duplex house. 1. a house having separate apartments for two families, especially a two-story house having a complete apartment on each floor and two separate entrances. Also called duplex.
Duplex can describe a confusing variety of things, depending on the technical field. Most of us use it as a noun: a duplex can be either a two-family house or a two-story apartment. In computer science and telecommunications, duplex (or full-duplex) communication can go in both directions at once, while half-duplex communication can go only one way at a time.
In telecommunication, duplex communication means that both ends of the communication can send and receive signals at the same time. Full-duplex communication is the same thing. Half-duplex is also bidirectional communication but signals can only flow in one direction at a time. Simplex communication means that communication can only flow in one direction and never flow back the other way.
Duplex Ultrasound. Duplex ultrasound is a non-invasive evaluation of blood flow through your arteries and veins . This test provides information to help your vascular surgeon make a sound diagnosis and outline a treatment plan. Accuracy is critical, so ultrasound testing should ALWAYS be performed by a credentialed sonographer in an accredited vascular laboratory.

No it is not bad to eat to many bananas.Its bad if that's all u eat but its like any other fruit it means your getting a lot of nutrition from the bananas. I eat 2 bananas a day, but when I eat 3 or more a day, my semen volume increases a lot. And she just loves it. Bananas and pineapples makes it taste better. Go for it guys, shoot it on to her face, taste good and smells good too. It would depend on exactly how many you ate, but bananas are very high in potassium.
Generally, it is recommended to eat 2 bananas a day. The amount of bananas you consume through the day will depend on your tolerance to vitamins and minerals, as some people are simply more capable of consuming vitamins and minerals without any complication.
It states tha tmen aged 19 and over and women aged 19 to 30 should eat two cups of fruit per day, and women who are aged 31 and over should eat one and a half cups of fruit per day. A single banana will provide you with around one cup of fruit, therefore, an adult is recommended to eat 1.5 to 2 bananas a day. Also, remember that over consumption of bananas can pose potential risks to your health. Here we list a chart for nutritional value of bananas.
How many bananas should you eat per day? A: There is no specific number of bananas that an individual should eat each day. However, most health experts recommend that individuals eat no more than two bananas per day.
So remember when you are thinking – how many bananas should you eat in a day? Too many may be harmful. Bananas contain substances called Phenylethylamine, Tyramine, and amino acids, all of which can cause dilation in the blood vessels, causing an increased flow of blood to the brain, which can lead to headaches.
Experts advise that two bananas per day provide sufficient nutrients and calories for the average individual. When calculating the exact number of bananas an individual can eat per day, individuals should consider factors such as height, weight and general overall health status. Learn more about Fruits & Veggies.
If you're diabetic, you'll probably be in a coma by the end of the day and I would therefore recommend against it. It has a high sugar content. Bananas have about 25 grams of carbs. Eat them sparingly and consider what else you'll be eating. You want to shoot for no more than 60 grams of carbs per meal. If not, I think it is okay (provided you also eat nutritionally balanced meals too and not just the four bananas). The Food and Nutrition Board's Institute of Medicine recommends that most adults get 4.7 grams of potassium per day. Four bananas would provide about 1.7 grams or about a third of that recommendation.
You could eat 2-3 organic bananas and be constipated for a day. Where as eating 2-3 genetically engineered bananas have less of an effect. So to sum up your question, don't eat too many bananas in one sitting. 2 bananas per day is a good average.
Since then, I've limited my intake to one banana a day. If you consume more than a banana a day, routinely, I would be wary of an unhealthy sodium-potassium ratio. It's probably not safe. I consumed two bananas a day for approximately eighteen months.
Bananas are a healthy choice for a balanced diet because they are high in potassium and fiber while being low in calories. According to experts at Healthline and LiveScience, the vitamins and minerals found in bananas can aid the healing process by stimulating red blood cell growth.
Offset Loan. Offset Loan. A type of loan in which the borrower maintains a savings account with the lender so that the account balance is netted against the loan outstanding for purpose of interest calculation. The interest rate on Offset loans is typically higher than the ones without this feature.

Meaning something 'set off' against something else, a counterbalance is from 1769; the verb in this sense is from 1792. As a type of printing, in which the inked impression is first made on a rubber roller then transferred to paper, it is recorded from 1906.
A reduced offset positions the wheel's hub-mounting surface farther inward, placing the bulk of the wheel farther outward. If you didn't change anything, then half of the wheel's extra width would land underneath the fender and probably interfere with something it shouldn't.
If you don't have any extra space, consider reducing offset to push the wheel away from the suspension. In other words, say you've got an inch of clearance between the wheel or tire and, say, an upper control arm. It'll take a wheel 2 inches wider to smack up against that arm.
…back of the wheel. Offset and wheel width will be marked on the back of the original and aftermarket wheels, but backspacing needs to be measured. What does this all mean to you? Since we have already checked to see what fits your vehicle, all listed wheels have a compatible offset and backspacing….
What Does a Refund Offset by the Treasury Department Mean? by Alia Nikolakopulos. If you receive a notice from the Department of Treasury that your tax refund is subject to offset, it means your refund might be intercepted to pay another bill you or your spouse owe. The Internal Revenue Service sends you a letter to let you know this will happen and gives you information about the agency you owe.
Negative Offset: A wheel with an offset less than zero positions its hub-mounting surface closer to its inboard side, giving the illusion that the wheel's been moved away from the car and increasing track width. The smaller the number, the farther away the wheel's mass will sit.
If you are an injured spouse and want to receive your portion of the refund subject to offset, file IRS Form 8379. If you know your joint refund is subject to offset before you file, you can submit the form with your return. If you find out about the offset after you file, send the form in separately.

The timing of two cosmic events will present skywatchers with a great opportunity to see Venus in the daytime sky on Friday, if weather conditions are good. Venus is the third brightest natural object in the sky, behind the sun and the moon. Even though Venus is very bright, it's not always easy to find in the daytime sky. But on Dec. 6, Venus shines at its brightest, with a brightness magnitude of -4.9. Brighter stars have lower magnitude numbers. The brightest stars in sky are a magnitude 1, while the full moon is a magnitude -12.7, for example.
Quick Answer. The moon is the brightest and most easily visible object in the night sky. Unlike stars, the moon doesn't actually produce any light but reflects light from the sun. The moon's brightness changes periodically, depending on its phases.

This process allows people to observe the moon's phases. The full moon is the brightest phase, while the new moon is the phase when little or no bright part of the moon is visible. Other bright objects that are easily visible in the night sky include Venus, Jupiter, Mars and Saturn. Learn more about Astronomy
As the brightest thing in the sky by a wide margin, the Sun has an apparent visual magnitude of about -27, while the full Moon ranks between -13 and -12. The ISS is consistently the brightest artificial object at -6, while Venus peaks at around -5. When and if Mayak is launched, it will shine with an apparent magnitude of -10, which would make it second only to the Moon as the brightest object in the night sky.
To see them look to the west after sunset. It’s best to wait a few minutes for the sky to get dark. Venus is pretty obvious; it’s the third brightest natural object in the sky (after the Sun and Moon). Mars is still fairly bright and easy to spot below it. Uranus, though, is just on the edge of visibility to the naked eye even from dark sites, so you’ll probably need binoculars to spot it.

Two of the major reasons why you or someone you know might smell like a used sock in a high school football locker is due to two chemical compounds called ammonia and aldehydes. Ammonia toxicity and aldehyde toxicity are two common findings in clinical practice and both can wreak havoc on your health and not only leave you searching for a stronger deodorant, but also with physical, mental and neurological symptoms.
Problems with your liver and kidney's natural detox cycle, muscles breakup during exercise to provide sugar to body and excess cortisol production can lead to increased ammonia in your blood. Chloramine found in water sources, consuming meat that has ammonia added to kill E. Coli and salmonella and candida overgrowth can lead to ammonia toxicity.
Sinusitis can be categorized into: 1  Acute sinusitis, where the patient experiences sudden cold-like symptoms, including a runny or stuffed nose, and pain in the face. 2  If the inflammation continues for 4-8 weeks, this is known as subacute sinusitis. 3  Sinusitis lasting more than 8 weeks is termed chronic sinusitis.
While body odor isn’t an absolute sign of ammonia toxicity, if you have any foul odors, leaving your body, you know you have an underlying health imbalance that you could benefit by looking into. 1  I love functional medicine. I love physical medicine. 2  I love functional medicine. I love physical medicine.
Patients with liver disease often experience the following symptoms: 1  Dark-colored urine. 2  Itchiness. 3  Nausea. 4  Vomiting. 5  Long-term tiredness. 6  Pain and swelling in the abdominal region. 7  Yellow skin and eyes (jaundice) 8  Pale, tar-colored, or bloody stools. 9  Decreased appetite. 10  Swollen legs and ankles. 11  Skin that bruises easily.
Some symptoms of functional or overt ammonia toxicity include: Fasciculations (muscle twitches) Hyper-excitability. Seizures. Brain swelling. Increased brain glutamate. Low serotonin levels. Headaches.
Ammonia Smell in Nose Experiencing a constant strange odor, for example an ammonia smell in nose, is a common symptom, but it can be very unpleasant and worrying. There are many possible causes for this, some of which will resolve on their own while others are more serious.
We will cover ammonia toxicity in this article. If you are someone that can’t stand the smell of strong perfume or gets headaches when walking through the mall, you may have an aldehyde problem. Ammonia Toxicity. Ammonia is a normal byproduct of the digestion of fats and proteins in the body.
However, persistent phantosmia may need treatment with the following: 1  Short-term relief can be achieved by washing the nasal passages with a saline solution. 2  There are many types of nasal spray and drops to ease your symptoms. 3  Some patients may be prescribed anti-convulsants, sedatives, or anti-depressants.
In this article, we’ll outline some of the more frequent reasons for constant unpleasant smells, how you can tell what you have, and what the recommended treatments are. Possible Causes and Treatments of Ammonia Smell in Nose 1. Sweating. Excessive sweating is one of the main reasons for an ammonia smell in nose. Sweat in itself has no smell, but when it is exposed to bacteria on the skin, it can develop a foul odor. This is mostly due to bacterial digestion of apocrine sweat.
Chromium is a steel-gray lustrous metal that is important as an additive in the manufacture of steel alloys (chrome steel, chrome-nickel steel, stainless steel) and greatly increases the durability and resistance of these metals; hence its use in metal prosthetic implants.
Blood Sugar, High Cholesterol & More. Chromium, a type of chemical element that’s actually a hard and brittle metal, is a trace mineral needed by the body in small amounts for healthy functioning. What is chromium most well-researched for in regard to promoting health? Blood sugar and diabetes control, heart health, weight management and brain health are all known benefits of chromium.
Recommended Daily Intake of Chromium. 1  Infants 0 to 6 months: 0.2 micrograms. 2  Children 7 to 12 months: 5.5 micrograms. 3  1 to 3 years: 11 micrograms. 4  4 to 8 years: 15 micrograms. 5  9 to 13 years: 25 micrograms for boys, 21 micrograms for girls. 6  Teens 14 to 18 years: 35 micrograms for boys, 24 micrograms for girls.
Health Benefits of Chromium. 1  1. Helps Control Blood Sugar and Prevent Diabetes. 2  2. Helps Reduce High Cholesterol. 3  3. May Help Prevent Weight Gain and Overeating. 4  4. Helps Maintain Brain Health and Fight Cognitive Decline. 5  5. May Help Improve Skin Health and Prevent Acne. 6  6. Supports a Healthy Metabolism and Energy Levels.
Google continues to take an extremely active role in the Chromium open source project, but there's also a thriving open source community behind it, with many contributions from other individuals and organizations, Shah said. The portion of Chromium that contains Google-authored code is released under the permissive BSD license.
Adequate intakes for chromium are based on age and gender and are as follows: (2) 1  Infants 0 to 6 months: 0.2 micrograms. 2  Children 7 to 12 months: 5.5 micrograms. 3  1 to 3 years: 11 micrograms. 4  4 to 8 years: 15 micrograms. 5  9 to 13 years: 25 micrograms for boys, 21 micrograms for girls.
The Top 10 Most Expensive Disease Treatments. The organic form of chromium exists in a dinicotino-glutathionine complex in natural foods and is better absorbed than the inorganic form. Good dietary sources of chromium include brewer's yeast, liver, potatoes with skin, beef, fresh vegetables, and cheese.
What Is Chromium Beneficial For and How Do We Get Enough? According to the USDA, chromium deficiency isn’t very common in the U.S. and other developed nations since most people consume enough chromium on a daily basis on average to meet or exceed the “adequate intake” amount (the total amount needed to support health and prevent chromium deficiency).
Chromium is an open source project, and some other organizations may choose to modify it to give their users a tailored experience, said Shah. Family Ties One of the main commonalities between Chromium and Chrome is access to the Chrome Web Store. Google introduced this open marketplace for Web apps in 2010.
If you've ever used Google's free Chrome browser, you may be aware that it's closely related to another, similarly named Google project called Chromium. Chrome and Chromium share a heavy portion of their core browser code, but Chrome is a proprietary Google product, while Chromium is open source. Both serve Linux, Windows and Mac OS X platforms, however, and both continue to vie for user share with Mozilla's open source Firefox, their distant cousin.
1 For patients not covered by health insurance, radiation therapy can cost $10,000-$50,000 or more, depending on the type of cancer, number of treatments needed and especially the type of radiation used. For patients covered by health insurance, out-of-pocket costs for radiation therapy typically consist of doctor visit, lab and prescription drug copays as well as coinsurance of 10%-50% for procedures and surgery.

For patients covered by health insurance, out-of-pocket costs for radiation therapy typically consist of doctor visit, lab and prescription drug copays as well as coinsurance of 10%-50% for procedures and surgery.
Of the $26K, $493 was for the initial consultation, $15K was for the treatment setup and design, and $10,826 was the cost for 11 treatments. That’s an average of $984 per treatment, with insurance paying out a fair percentage – an average of $716 per treatment.lso wanted to see what the usual cost of breast cancer treatment would run. Looks like you(your insurance) got off a lot less than our current bill. My wife had 10 treatments in 1 week (radium) ..the insurance got charged $23,000 per day. total bill $132,000!

Universal Grammar (UG) is a theory in linguistics, usually credited to Noam Chomsky, proposing that the ability to learn grammar is hard-wired into the brain.It is sometimes known as 'mental grammar', and as opposed to other 'grammars', e.g. prescriptive, descriptive and pedagogical.he distinction is important because there is a long history of argument about UG*, whereas most people working on language agree that there is Universal Grammar. Many people assume that Chomsky means UG* when he writes UG (and in some cases he might actually mean UG*, though not in the passage quoted above).
So recursion as the essential building block of human language, if Chomsky's correct, is difficult for me to apply as an intellectual trying to build a theory of human language, because it's not clear what it is, and it's not clear that it is in fact essential to different languages.nd if that's the case, then you would look for evidence that this language lacked recursion.

Chomsky argued that the human brain contains a limited set of rules for organizing language. This implies in turn that all languages have a common structural basis; the set of rules is what is known as universal grammar.he distinction is important because there is a long history of argument about UG*, whereas most people working on language agree that there is Universal Grammar. Many people assume that Chomsky means UG* when he writes UG (and in some cases he might actually mean UG*, though not in the passage quoted above).
Recursion is a property of language. From a Linguistics viewpoint, recursion can also be called nesting. As I've stated in this answer to what defines a language (third-last bullet point), recursion is a phenomenon where a linguistic rule can be applied to the result of the application of the same rule..Let's see an example of this.Consider the sentence:s I've stated in this answer to what defines a language (third-last bullet point), recursion is a phenomenon where a linguistic rule can be applied to the result of the application of the same rule..

That basically summarizes coverage of a recent study on songbirds' artificial grammar system. More on that later.

The theory of Universal Grammar proposes that if human beings are brought up under normal conditions (not conditions of extreme sensory deprivation), then they will always develop language with a certain property X (e.g., distinguishing nouns from verbs, or distinguishing function words from lexical words).he distinction is important because there is a long history of argument about UG*, whereas most people working on language agree that there is Universal Grammar. Many people assume that Chomsky means UG* when he writes UG (and in some cases he might actually mean UG*, though not in the passage quoted above).
For Chomsky’s theory to hold true, all of the languages in the world must share certain structural properties. And indeed, Chomsky and other generative linguists like him have shown that the 5000 to 6000 languages in the world, despite their very different grammars, do share a set of syntactic rules and principles.hese linguists believe that this “universal grammar” is innate and is embedded somewhere in the neuronal circuitry of the human brain. And that would be why children can select, from all the sentences that come to their minds, only those that conform to a “deep structure” encoded in the brain’s circuits.
Recursion, in sum, allows language to become an infinite system. The Chomskyan view is that this ability is quite special, unique to humans. It is, in essence, what distinguishes us from other animals-the source of complex thought and communication, and thus complex mathematical, artistic and linguistic ability.Abe and Watanabe's study shows that songbirds are able to process a recursive grammar-this is perhaps the most significant aspect of their paper.ore on that later. First, a summary of the study: An influential hypothesis, put forward by Noam Chomsky and colleagues, is that one ability-recursion-enables language, and that humans are alone in having this capacity.
The preferred name resolution method is called recursion. Generally speaking, recursion refers to the process of having the DNS server itself to make queries to other DNS servers on behalf of the client who made the original request. In essence, the DNS server becomes a DNS client.f the DNS server does not know the address of the requested site, then it will forward the request to another DNS server. In order to do so, the DNS server must know of the IP address of another DNS server that it can forward the request to. This is the job of root hints.
You could in principle have a human language that is constrained by the culture, so that the language proper lacks recursion, but the brain has recursion. And that's very difficult to reconcile with Chomsky's ideas on where recursion comes from.Chomsky's absolutely correct to recognize the importance of recursion, but the role that he gives it, and the role that Hauser and Tecumseh Fitch give it, to me has got things backwards.nd if that's the case, then you would look for evidence that this language lacked recursion.

Foods That Will Increase Testosterone Production. Testosterone, or also known as the “male” hormone is an androgenic and anabolic steroid produced in the testes in men and in very small amounts in ovaries in women. Men produce about 50 to 60 percent more testosterone than women.
So adding a few of the foods listed below can boost your testosterone especially when combined with regular weight training. -Nuts in general are great source of essential fatty acids.Essential fatty acids provide raw material for healthy production of hormones in both men and women.
At last we’ve reached the final post of Testosterone Week and based on the comments from you all, this is the post you’ve been most looking forward to. Today I’m going to share what I did during my 90-day experiment in order to double my total and free testosterone levels.
At the end of the month I got my testosterone levels tested and found that my total T was 383 ng/dL and my free T was 7.2 pg/mL – close to the average for an 85-100-year-old man. I then began a 90-day experiment to see how diet and lifestyle changes could boost that number.
Side effects of “Low-T” include low libido, limp erections, hair thinning, muscle loss, fat gain, depression ... In fact, one study found that that the lower a man’s testosterone levels, the higher his risk of death from any cause—heart disease in particular.
If you have lower than normal levels of testosterone, eating the right foods can help increase your testosterone levels and rebuild your sex drive.Testosterone production is dependent on zinc and vitamin B, both of these are abundant in many of the foods we eat regularly.
-Red meat has high levels of zinc so it is very good part of a testosterone diet.Red meat sources include steaks,pork chops,ribs etc…. 2.Nuts and Seeds. -Nuts in general are great source of essential fatty acids.Essential fatty acids provide raw material for healthy production of hormones in both men and women.
I bought most of the ingredients for my Testosterone Salad at Whole Foods. For those curious, I added up all the ingredients and divided by six (I typically ate six of these salads in a week). The cost per salad was roughly $5. That’s about the price many folks pay every day for a crappy fast food meal.

An added testosterone benefit of my high fat and balanced protein and carb diet was that it probably helped me lose some body fat (I went from 18% to 12% body fat). Studies show that high fat diets actually contribute to increased body fat loss.
Double jointing is performed at our facilities using state-of-the-art welding methods and accurate non-destructive testing controls. Tenaris provides double jointing services to oil and gas companies in order to reduce delivery and pipe laying times, which represents a large portion of the total CAPEX of an offshore development.
RE: Welding symbol questions (fillet welds) It took me a long time to get comfortable with welding/weld symbols. An AWS seminar really helped me. My responses below are based on the 98 edition of A2.4. 1. A double fillet weld symbol is shown in Fig 8(B) for the combined intermittent and continuous weld both sides of the T-Joint.
A Basis for Using Single-Welded or Double-Welded Lap-Joints for Steel Water Pipe. A Basis for Using Single-Welded or Double-Welded Lap-Joints for Steel Water Pipe. Field-welded lap-joints were first successfully used in the 1920s to join sections of an all-steel pipe transmission line in Texas.
Double jointing is performed at our facilities using state-of-the-art welding methods and accurate non-destructive testing control through X-ray or automatic UT controls. After welding, each double joint is coated for thermal insulation or corrosion protection according to customer specifications.
One of those factors is the requirement that the weld joint needs to be able to physically accommodate the chosen welding process and any accompanying welding equipment (nozzles, torches, etc.). Consider the case where the joint design incorporates a bevel (on at least one side of the joint) and a root opening.
Fillet weld. Fillet welding refers to the process of joining two pieces of metal together whether they be perpendicular or at an angle. These welds are commonly referred to as Tee joints which are two pieces of metal perpendicular to each other or Lap joints which are two pieces of metal that overlap and are welded at the edges.
The joint preparation of the groove has a dramatic effect on the shape of the cross-sectional area of the first-pass weld nugget. It is imperative to achieve a weld that possesses a width-to-depth ratio of at least 1.25 in order to mitigate the crack-sensitivity of the weld.
Parts of a fillet weld. There are 5 pieces to each Fillet weld known as the Root, Toe, Face, Leg and Throat. The root of the weld is the part of deepest penetration which is the opposite angle of the Hypotenuse. The toes of the weld are essentially the edges or the points of the hypotenuse.
In the process of selecting a suitable butt weld joint preparation for thick plate (greater than 1 in), the most apparent consideration is unquestionably the joint economy – the practice of minimizing the volume of weld metal required to fill the joint.
Welding symbol questions (fillet welds) Welding symbol questions (fillet welds) 1. Double fillet symbols can be used for both T and lap situations (though AWS A2.4 doesn't seem to show the use of this symbol for a lap joint--is that an omission, or are other references showing this usage incorrect?).
What is $Windows.~WS and Where/How/When is it Used? As I mentioned, this folder is found inside your Windows Drive after the up-gradation process. During upgrade process, important data from your previous version of Windows is backed-up. This data includes Windows folders, profiles, program file directory and other important locations.
Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community. As we understand your concern in this regard. '$windows.~WS' folder involves in Windows 10 upgrade and dedicated for windows Management for the upcoming upgrades. It includes customized XML files for specificity and the same can't be used for installing Windows 10 on some other device.
Is it safe to delete $Windows.~BT & $Windows.~WS folders. $Windows.~BT and $Windows.~WS are temporary folders and can be safely deleted. If you are unable to right-click on them and select Delete, you can use the following commands to change permissions and force-delete them. Right-click on Start button to open the WinX Menu.
The BT and the WS folders are the same thing, the feedstock for the Windows upgrade. If your copy of Win10 is activated, then you can run disk cleaner to get rid of the windows.old and the $windows --BT folders. The $windows---WS folder does NOT clean up by the disk cleaner.
After you upgrade to Windows 10 you may notice two folders on your System or C Drive named $Windows.~BT and $Windows.~WS. These folders are created by Windows, during the upgrade process. The question now is – Is it safe to delete these $Windows.~BT and $Windows.~WS folders?
Yea, running the clean up even as an admin has kept the $Windows.~WS folder. $windows.~WS contains 2 images, one an ESD (installx86.esd or installx64.esd) in sources, and another is an install.wim in $windows.~WS\sources\windows\sources.
Now copy-paste the following and hit Enter to delete the contents of $Windows.~WS directory. takeown /F C:\$Windows.~WS\* /R /A. icacls C:\$Windows.~WS\*.* /T /grant administrators:F. rmdir /S /Q C:\$Windows.~WS\. If this works, you will see a Successfully processed message.
What is the $Windows.~WS Folder. With the announcement of Windows 10, a majority of Windows 7 and Windows 8 users have upgraded their Windows to the latest OS. When you upgrade your previous Windows to Windows 10 rather than clean install, you will see two hidden folders on your C Drive (any drive where you installed Windows).
One of those hidden folders will be $Windows.~WS . You can view these folders by un-hiding the hidden folders from the View panel at the top. Having a look at the size of this folder, you will notice that it has occupied a huge space inside your Windows drive. So, a lot of questions arise about the presence of this folder.
$Windows.~BT and $Windows.~WS are temporary folders and can be safely deleted. If you are unable to right-click on them and select Delete, you can use the following commands to change permissions and force-delete them. Right-click on Start button to open the WinX Menu.

Which side is the best at Victoria Falls: Zimbabwe or Zambia? This depends entirely on your vacation wishes. Both sides offer magnificent views of the Falls, but it’s your accommodation preferences and choice of activities that might influence your decision.
With Victoria Falls Town right there, Zimbabwe is the better choice for souvenir shopping. There’s a large outdoor market with rows upon rows of intricate wooden carvings, salad bowls and soapstone animals of all shapes and sizes.
Victoria Falls vs Livingstone – Other considerations This may seem obvious but if you are doing a Zimbabwe safari or a Zambia safari, it makes sense from a logistical and cost point of view to stay on the same side as the rest of your safari!
Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe. Victoria Falls is a town in the province of Matabeleland North, Zimbabwe. It lies on the southern bank of the Zambezi River at the western end of the Victoria Falls themselves.
Which side to visit (Zambia or Zimbabwe) and the best time to see Victoria Falls depends on what a traveller wants to see and experience. Essentially there are 3 factors at play: 1. Which side offers the best view of the actual waterfall? 2. Political / social situation 3. Flights / Airports
The principal gorges are (see reference for note about these measurements): 1  First Gorge: the one the river falls into at Victoria Falls. 2  Second Gorge: 250 m south of falls, 2.15 km long (270 yd south, 2350 yd long), spanned by the Victoria Falls Bridge.

Facts About the Falls. Victoria Falls lies in between Zambia and Zimbabwe in Southern Africa. The falls are part of two national parks, Mosi-oa-Tunya National Park in Zambia and Victoria Falls National Park in Zimbabwe. The falls are just over 1 mile wide (1.7 km) and 355 feet (108 m) high. During the wet season over 500 million liters (19 million cubic feet) of water plummets over the edge into the Zambezi River.
If you want to visit Victoria Falls both in Zimbabwe and Zambia, the best bet is getting a KAZA visa, (also called Univisa) which allows free movement between Zambia, Zimbabwe and the Chobe area of Botswana for up to 30 days.

The nitrogenous bases on the two strands of DNA pair up, purine with pyrimidine (A with T, G with C), and are held together by weak hydrogen bonds. Watson and Crick discovered that DNA had two sides, or strands, and that these strands were twisted together like a twisted ladder -- the double helix.
1 A nitrogenous base Only four nitrogenous bases are present in DNA: thymine, cytosine, adenine and guanine. 2  The sugars and phosphates of the nucleotides bond strongly together to form a backbone to which these four bases connect, forming the rungs of the double helix.
The bases come in two categories: thymine and cytosine are pyrimidines, while adenine and guanine are purines (). The pyrimidine structure is produced by a six-membered, two-nitrogen molecule; purine refers to a nine-membered, four-nitrogen molecule.
The four nitrogen bases found in DNA are adenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine. Each of these bases are often abbreviated a single letter: A (adenine), C (cytosine), G (guanine), T (thymine). The bases come in two categories: thymine and cytosine are pyrimidines, while adenine and guanine are purines ().
Deoxyribose is the pentose sugar found in this type of polynucleotide, hence its name D eoxyribo n ucleic A cid, or DNA. The nitrogenous bases found in DNA are, adenine, guanine, cytosine and thymine. DNA molecules have two polynucleotide chains, held together in a ladderlike structure.
1 In DNA, Adenine binds to Thymine. 2  In RNA, Adenine binds to Uracil. 3  These hydrogen-bond interactions between nucleotides C-G and A-T or A-U are referred to as base-pairing or complementary base-pairing. 4  Base-pairing holds the double-stranded DNA molecule together.
Each base pair is formed from two complementary nucleotides (purine with pyrimidine) bound together by hydrogen bonds. The base pairs in DNA are adenine with thymine and cytosine with guanine. DNA has a spiral staircase-like structure.

Note that adenine only bonds with thymine, and cytosine only bonds with guanine. The nitrogen bases are held together by hydrogen bonds: adenine and thymine form two hydrogen bonds; cytosine and guanine form three hydrogen bonds.
DNA consists of a phosphate group, a sugar, and a nitrogenous base. The structure of DNA is a helical, double-stranded macromolecule with bases projecting into the interior of the molecule. These two strands are always complementary in sequence.
The repurchase of shares has slightly reduced the total dividend Apple pays.

“It was high time to do this,” said David Rolfe, chief investment officer of Wedgewood Partners Inc., which holds Apple shares. The dividend will cost Apple about $10 billion a year and represents a yield of 1.8 percent on the stock’s closing price today.The company generated $16 billion in cash in the first quarter of fiscal 2012, which ended in December.ome investors will only buy shares in companies that pay a dividend. Apple last paid a dividend in 1995, before Jobs returned as CEO and led the introduction of top-selling products including the iPod, iPhone and iPad.
Cook said he hopes the dividend will open up Apple's stock to a new investor base. Apple's dividend yield -- the percentage of a company's share price that it pays out in annual dividends -- is currently 1.8%.pple's dividend yield -- the percentage of a company's share price that it pays out in annual dividends -- is currently 1.8%.
In 2014, Apple raised the dividend 8 percent, but shares had gone up more, so even with the increase, the yield only got to 2.5 percent. The continued rally in Apple stock has pulled the yield on that dividend down to 1.5. Kessler thinks Apple will raise the dividend by as much as 8 percent, to 15 percent.If Kessler is right, and at its current stock price around $125, the yield would go to between 1.6 percent and 1.7 percent.or Apple to pay out 2 percent of its $725 billion market value would cost about $14.5 billion a year, or less than a quarter of its operating cash flow last fiscal year, but $3.4 billion more than it spent on dividends in fiscal 2014. Matching Intel's payout would cost about $24 billion.
Apple is currently paying 47 cents a share as a dividend. A doubling would bring that to 94 cents a share. RBC says the company will likely generate $66.6 billion in free cash flow in fiscal 2015, making a $65 billion capital return program very affordable.pple currently yields 1.5%, a curiously low dividend that falls short of the roughly 1.9% yield on the Standard & Poor’s 500.

Coir ( /ˈkɔɪər/), or coconut fibre, is a natural fibre extracted from the husk of coconut[1] and used in products such as floor mats, doormats, brushes and mattresses. Coir is the fibrous material found between the hard, internal shell and the outer coat of a coconut.

When you buy a coconut coir product, you’re really buying three types of coconut coir: the fiber, the pith (or coconut peat), or the coco chips. Together, they provide a powerful growing medium. Apart, they have very specific benefits.
Coir - Processing. 1  Green coconuts, harvested after about six to 12 months on the palm, contain pliable white fibres. 2  The fibrous husks are soaked in pits or in nets in a slow-moving body of water to swell and soften the fibres. 3  The immature husks are suspended in a river or water-filled pit for up to ten months.
Coir fiber is rarely used as a potting material, except for orchids, and does not need buffering, as it has a very low cation-exchange capacity (CEC) capacity, hence not retaining salts. Coir does provide a suitable substrate for horticultural use as a soilless potting medium.
Coconut coir is an amazing growing medium for hydroponic and indoor use. Find out what it is, how it's made, and the best coco coir to use in your garden.

Coir is the fibrous material found between the hard, internal shell and the outer coat of a coconut. Other uses of brown coir (made from ripe coconut) are in upholstery padding, sacking and horticulture. White coir, harvested from unripe coconuts, is used for making finer brushes, string, rope and fishing nets.

Bristle coir is the longest variety of coir fibre. It is manufactured from retted coconut husks through a process called defibring. The coir fibre thus extracted is then combed using steel combs to make the fibre clean and to remove short fibres.
Typically, you will need to install smaller rods 1 lower than the finished length, while rods with a diameter of 2 or more will need to be installed approximately 2 lower (if you want the drapery to touch the floor).• For a layered look, convert an existing single rod into a double with our conversion kit (C).
1 You may also consider the alternative of using a grommet setter to place holes and grommets into the rod pocket area of the curtain so that you may use the rings unaided without the use of hooks or clips. 2  A grommet setter may be found in craft or fabric supply stores.
Instructions for attaching the hooks are included with your drapery panels.• We recommend using 7 drapery rings to hang each 50W rod pocket panel, and 13 rings to hang each 100W rod pocket panel.• Our sheer rod pocket drapery can be used with clip rings (A).
HOW TO MEASURE FOR DRAPERY & WINDOW From the fabric you select to the hardware that you choose, window treatments are an opportunity to define a room’s style. This guide outlines the various drapery styles and window accessories we offer, and provides easy-to-follow instructions on how to measure for each.
First, let’s take a look at how most people hang their curtains and draperies. Most just use clip rings all the way across. The final result looks something like this…. The problem with that method is that from the side, you can see several inches of space between the curtains and the window (or closet, in my case).
2. DETERMINE ROD PLACEMENT • If not using drapery rings: Measure from bottom of rod to floor (see B). • If using drapery rings: With drapery attached to the rings, measure from bottom of rod to top of drapery fabric; add this measurement to your drapery length to determine rod placement.
All that you’ll need is a drapery pin and an eye screw for each end. First, screw an eye screw into the wall at the end of the rod (between the bracket and the finial) at the same height as the top of the curtains (minus about 1/8th of an inch). Now remove the drapery ring…. …and insert a drapery pin so that the top of the hook is right at or just below the top of the curtains. Now move the last drapery ring into the space between the bracket and the finial, and slip the drapery hook over the eye screw. No more unsightly gap!
A – C. ROD POCKET • •Offers casual simplicity.• Features a fabric casing along the top that can be slipped over a rod when using the drapery without hooks or rings (C); can also be used with drapery rings (A & B).
Attach specialty clips or hooks to the curtain rings. Hooks pierce the fabric directly, while clips do not alter the curtains at all. Attach the hooks or clips to the curtain at the spots that were previously marked out. Hang your curtain via the rings that are now attached.
Tips & Warnings. 1  Hooks provide a more stable solution than clips, but may permanently alter or damage the fabric of the curtains. 2  If the fabric of the curtains is woven loosely, such as a light brocade, you may be able to use hooks by sliding the tip between two threads in the fabric.

Quick Answer. The standard size for a patio door depends on the style, with hinged versions measuring 71 1/4 inches by 79 1/2 inches and sliding door versions available in three basic sizes. Patio doors are typically available in two- and four-panel configurations.
Assign each activity to a different part of the patio. Allow ample space for the activity itself, traffic flow through and around the area, and outdoor furniture, which tends to be larger than indoor furniture. If the patio you've planned isn't large enough, expand it or look for ways its spaces can serve double duty.
That means a table with a diameter of 6 feet should have an umbrella with a diameter of 10 feet, so the entire table has shade. For height, about 7 to 9 feet is short enough to provide shade but tall enough that your guests don't need to duck underneath, unless you invite a basketball team over for dinner.
However, a getaway patio — perhaps a new space in addition to an entertaining patio — can be more remote, toward the back of the property. Walk around the property and check out vantage points to determine location and orientation.
Patio Planning 101. Enrich your outdoor living space for years to come with a patio design that's well thought out from start to finish.
Sliding doors are the most common ones used for patios. Sizes to choose from include a 60-inch door with a frame size of 59 1/2 by 79 1/2 inches; a 72-inch door with a frame size of 71 1/2 by 79 1/2 inches; and a 96-inch door with a frame size of 95 1/2 by 79 1/2 inches.
Then move in the furniture and equipment you'll have on the patio. If you haven't purchased the furniture yet, use interior furnishings and add about a foot more space for each item. Figure about 2 feet square for each outdoor chair, plus about 1 or 2 feet to push back from a table.
Frame Material. The most popular materials for patio umbrella frames are wood, aluminum and fiberglass. Wood umbrellas have a timeless style that obviously pairs well with a wood dining table. The wood is almost always treated to ensure that it stands up to the daily wear and tear of outdoor use.
Buy your patio furniture first and arrange it where your patio will be. Use the space for a week or two, taking note of where people walk and the best spacing for the furniture. The size of your patio should be large enough to accommodate the furniture. Don't forget walk around space.
Determining the size of your patio is crucial. Many homeowners end up with a patio that is either too small or too large. Patios that are too small feel cramped after adding furniture, planters and a grill. Patios that are too large lose their intimacy.
• NADH, FADH2 – discuss role and how much energy each one produces. o NADH and FADH2 carry electrons released as GLUCOSE is broken down in. GLYCOLYSIS and KREBS CYCLE to the ETC where they release the. electrons to the ETC and the energy is used to make a H+ concentration. gradient used to power ATP Production. o 1 NADH makes 3 ATP, 1 FADH2 makes 2 ATP. Step in Cellular.
NADH, short for nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, is an important pyridine nucleotide that functions as an oxidative cofactor in eukaryotic cells. NADH plays a key role in the production of energy through redox reactions. NAD serves as a cofactor for dehydrogenases, reductases and hydroxylases, making it a major carrier of H+ and e- in major metabolic pathways such as glycolysis, the triacarboxylic acid cycle, fatty acid synthesis and sterold synthesis.
Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide (NAD) is a dinucleotide that functions as one of the most important coenzymes in the cell. The interconversion of NAD between the reduced (NADH) and oxidized (NAD+) forms is a common reaction in biological redox (oxidation-reduction) reactions. In cells, most oxidations are accomplished by the removal of hydrogen atoms. Each molecule of NAD+ can acquire two electrons; that is, be reduced by two electrons.
The metabolic pathway of glycolysis converts glucose to pyruvate by via a series of intermediate metabolites. Each chemical modification (red box) is performed by a different enzyme. Steps 1 and 3 consume ATP (blue) and steps 7 and 10 produce ATP (yellow).
NAD Therapy directly addresses the chemical damage in the brain that drugs and alcohol caused. Brain cells send signals to one another using a variety of chemicals neurotransmitters. (Serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine are examples of these). A neurotransmitter is emitted by one cell and is picked up by specialized receptors on neighboring cells. These normal nerve pathways cease to function properly in those suffering from addiction. NAD aids in the restoration of healthy brain function.
NAD is a breakthrough treatment for Addiction, Depression, PTSD, Stress and Chronic Fatigue the has proven to be fast, safe and effective. NAD Infusion Therapy is utilized to reduce cravings, minimize withdrawal and restore well being.
Because of the positive charge on the nitrogen atom in the nicotinamide ring, the oxidized form of this important redox reagent is often depicted as NAD+. In cells, most oxidations are accomplished by the removal of hydrogen atoms. NAD coenzyme plays a crucial role in this.
The purpose of cellular respiration. Provide the cell with energy in the form of ATP (Adenosine Tri-Phosphate) ATP is a temporary energy store. When bonds break they release energy, and it is this energy that drives the cell’s. processes. ATP----> ADP + iP (inorganic phosphate) + energy. The overall reaction.
For example, the intermediate dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) is a source of the glycerol that combines with fatty acids to form fat. Glycolysis is an oxygen independent metabolic pathway, meaning that it does not use molecular oxygen (i.e. atmospheric oxygen) for any of its reactions. However the products of glycolysis (pyruvate and NADH + H+) are sometimes metabolized using atmospheric oxygen.
●Glycolysis means the breakdown of the glucose molecule. ●Glucose contains 6 carbons C6H12O6. ●The process breaks glucose down into 2 molecules of Pyruvate. ●Pyruvate is the ionized form of pyruvic acid. ●Each molecule of pyruvate contains 3 carbons. ●Ion = electrically charged atom or molecule.
** There is no additional charge for the air brake test if you are taking a road test for a class. 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 licence and the vehicle you are using for the test is equipped with air brakes. • No cost applies for tests in these two situations: • You’re 65 or older; or.
During the normal operation of the brake system each port, pas-. sage, valve, etc. must direct air, allow air to move, vent, or cause another reaction. To understand the operation of each different valve, one must be able to read an air brake diagram. The first look at a control valve schematic diagram may be very intimidating. However, with some. guidelines the diagrams become a little more understandable. When trying to understand air brake.
For the service brakes (the ones used while driving for slowing or stopping) to be applied, the brake pedal is pushed, routing the air under pressure (approx 100–120 psi or 690–830 kPa or 6.89-8.27 bar) to the brake chamber, causing the brake to be engaged.
An air brake endorsement is only. required if your vehicle needs a CDL. Air brakes use compressed air to make the brakes. work. Air brakes are a good and safe way of. stopping large and heavy vehicles, but the brakes. must be well maintained and used properly. Air brakes are really three different braking. systems: service brake, parking brake, and. emergency brake. The service brake system applies and releases the. brakes when you use the brake pedal during. normal driving. The parking brake system applies and releases the. parking brakes when you use the parking brake.
The service brake chamber is used when only the application of service brake air is required on an axle. There will be no emergency braking provided on this axle. You will find service brake chambers on steer axles, some rear axles, and old trailers that use a relay emergency valve to apply parking air pressure to the service chamber. The spring brake Piggyback is a replacement part for repair of a spring brake chamber.
The study of this manual, together with. practical instruction, is recommended. for a driver who is preparing for the air. brake examination. A large illustration of. a complete dual air brake system is located. on the inside cover and can be folded out. and referred to when studying this manual. Study questions are included at the end of. each section so that readers may self–test. their understanding of the subject matter.
Some examples are: to provide force for braking, to. deliver air to a particular component, to offload bulk. goods, etc. Normal Braking. When the driver applies the foot brake, a plunger w ithin. the foot brake valve moves, opening channels within. the valve that allow the air pressure waiting there to.
Air brake (road vehicle) Truck air actuated disc brake. An air brake or, more formally, a compressed air brake system, is a type of friction brake for vehicles in which compressed air pressing on a piston is used to apply the pressure to the brake pad needed to stop the vehicle.

The requirement for vWF propeptide cleavage was shown by (1) a point mutation of the vWF propeptide cleavage site yielding pro-vWF that was defective in factor VIII binding and (2) correlation between efficiency of intracellular propeptide cleavage and factor VIII binding.
Von Willebrand factor testing includes VWF antigen, which measures the amount of VWF, and VWF activity (also known as Ristocetin Cofactor), which evaluates the function of VWF. Some laboratories may offer a panel that includes both of these tests along with a factor VIII activity test.
Von Willebrand Disease. Von Willebrand disease (VWD) is a genetic disorder caused by missing or defective von Willebrand factor (VWF), a clotting protein. VWF binds factor VIII, a key clotting protein, and platelets in blood vessel walls, which help form a platelet plug during the clotting process. The condition is named after Finnish physician Erik von Willebrand, a who first described it in the 1920s.
VWF also mediates the protection of factor VIII, a main cofactor of the intrinsic clotting pathway. Since vWF plays a critical role in both thrombotic and bleeding events, a decreased plasma level of this factor may point to a bleeding disorder, while an elevated plasma level may predict occurrence of thrombosis.
Although each subunit of a vWF multimer contains one factor VIII binding site, the ratio of circulating factor VIII to vWF observed in vivo is approximately 1:50.25-28 In vitro binding studies have yielded conflicting data for the number of available factor VIII binding sites/vWF subunit, with reported ratios from 1:1 to as low as 1:70.29-33 ...
Von Willebrand factor (vWF or VWF) is a protein that is one of several components of the coagulation system that work together, and in sequence, to stop bleeding within the body. VWF testing measures the amount of the protein present in blood and determines how well the protein functions.
Von Willebrand factor (VWF) testing is used to investigate excessive or recurrent bleeding episodes or a personal or family history of excessive bleeding. Testing is used to help diagnose von Willebrand disease (VWD) and distinguish between the various types of VWD. VWF is a protein, one of several components of the coagulation system that work together to stop bleeding and form a stable blood clot.
Von Willebrand Disease Von Willebrand disease (VWD) is a genetic disorder caused by missing or defective von Willebrand factor (VWF), a clotting protein. VWF binds factor VIII, a key clotting protein, and platelets in blood vessel walls, which help form a platelet plug during the clotting process. The condition is named after Finnish physician Erik von Willebrand, a who first described it in the 1920s. VWD is the most common bleeding disorder, affecting up to 1% of the US population.
Shear Stress and the Role of High Molecular Weight Von Willebrand Factor Multimers in Thrombus Formation
One of the key players in both hemostasis and thrombosis is von Willebrand factor (vWF), which demonstrates a duality between these two processes. Thrombus is structured by numerous elements, including endothelial cells, platelets, plasma proteins and shear stress alteration.
The Korean War, often referred to as The Forgotten War, was fought from June 25, 1950, to July 27, 1953. This website is dedicated to thanking and honoring all the veterans of the Korean War, their families, and especially those who lost loved ones in that war.
Quick Answer. There are no officially recognized beginning and ending dates for the Korean War, as neither the United States nor North Korea ever made an official declaration of war.
In the United States, we call it the Korean War (and sometimes the Forgotten War). North Korea calls it the Fatherland Liberation War. In South Korea, it’s called Six-Two-Five, after the day it started. China’s subtle name for the conflict is the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea.
Jun 25, 2015. 1  Though the Korean War started on this day 65 years ago—June 25, 1950—when North Korean tanks crossed the 38th parallel, the boundary with South Korea, TIME's reporting from the following week reveals it took several days for the United States to realize the scope of what had happened.
The Korean War combined old tactics and new ones on land, sea, and air. The paratroopers of the 187th Airborne Regimental Combat Team (known as the “Rakkasans”) conducted all of the airborne operations of the Korean War. They jumped into Sunch'ŏn, North Korea in 1950, and Munsan-ni, South Korea in 1952. The Rakkasans fought in a total of six campaigns in Korea.

Dates of the Korean War. The foundation for the Korean war was laid as early as 1945. The majority took place largely from 1950 to 1953. On January 12, 1950 Truman's Secretary of State Dean Acheson confirms Korea and Taiwan are outside American Far East Security cordon. On June 25, 1950 North Korea invades Republic of South Korea without Warning.

But really, it depends on the length of the exam, how much coffee you drink, and what your metabolism is like. Fat little babies take 100 hours to metabolise caffeine to half it's original amount in the body, whereas skinny cigarette smokers can burn through the same amount in just 3 hours.
Caffeine pills would be a better alternative, at least then you won't need the toilet. Personally the kind of energy rush that comes from caffeine, combined with the stress of the exam, make me go all jumpy and unable to concentrate at all. Also, my exams are three hours, so by the end it's worn off and I feel drained.
Drinking Coffee Before the Alcohol? CNN has an article today claiming that California researchers believe that drinking coffee can help prevent liver damage. According to the study, drinking coffee can reduce the risk of cirrhosis of the liver by 22 percent per cup each day. I have no idea what those numbers mean, but they sound good to me.
Drinking coffee before bed sets your body clock back by an hour, experts have found. The new study suggests caffeine goes much further than simply making it harder to sleep. Scientists discovered drinking the equivalent of a double espresso three hours before going to bed can turn your body clock back by an hour. Caffeine resets the clock by delaying a rise in the level of melatonin, the body's chief sleep hormone. This hormone tells your body the natural time to go to sleep and wake up.
Prior to a blood test, it is common that fasting is required. Commonly, it is done for 9 to 12 hours before the test is performed, according to the doctor’s advice. During the fasting, the patient is not advised to take any food or drink other than water.
Although some doctors may allow you to drink a small cup of unsweetened coffee prior to a cholesterol blood test, is advisable to avoid it while fasting for the test, since as little as it will, the result does affect the test result.
Each test is different and only your doctor can definitively tell you how to prepare for your blood tests. In what way or manner does drinking coffee before blood tests affect the results. For tests which require pre-test fasting, coffee will affect your blood, your metabolism and your blood test results. Only water is allowed for certain tests, otherwise an inaccurate reading may result. slide 2 of 5.
If you studied for a particular exam while drinking a grande Starbucks Pike Place; then do the same right before the exam—or if your professor allows, drink the coffee while taking the exam. Typically you want to mimic the mental condition (and physical surroundings) you put yourself in while you study.
Therefore, avoid drinking coffee during the fasting period, especially if you are expecting a very accurate blood test result that is important if you are suspected from a heart disease or cardiovascular issue. Having high triglycerides level also makes coffee absence for 9 to 12 hours before the test significant.
So if you drink tea when you study, drink tea for your exam (or Red Bull, or Dr. Pepper, or Espresso, or…Budweiser). Along with beverages, clothes might impact your performance. If you study in jeans and a t-shirt; take your exam in jeans and a t-shirt. If you study in sweats, wear sweats.
On to the BIG Casino in the sky... While it is always sad to see one of the grand dames of Las Vegas bite the dust, we must remember... without their demise we would not have Bellagio, Mandalay Bay, Venetian, Wynn Las Vegas, Aladdin (again), and a giant parking lot where the Landmark stood.
The Sands opened on December 15, 1952, as a low rise resort. Once the home of the Rat Pack, the Sands has a sordid history. The Sands was bought by Howard Hughes for $14.6 million on July 22, 1967. Hughes added a 17-story cylindrical tower, containing 777 rooms.
Entratter replaced Freedman as the president of the Sands Hotel following his death from heart surgery on January 20, 1958. Freedman's last wife Sadie subsequently lived in a suite in the Belmont Park wing into the mid 1960s until her death.
After several owners and legal matters, the Sands found its way to the building boom era of the 90's. In 1996, with the Bellagio under way and Caesars expanding, Sheldon Adelson bought the Sands and removed the historic landmark to create another. The Venetian Hotel now sits where Frank, Sammy and Dean once played.
The Dunes opened as a low rise resort in 1955. When the North Tower was added in 1964, it was one of the finest and largest hotels on the strip. The South Tower was added in 1979. The resort boasted an 18 hole golf course, a rooftop health spa and a 90 foot-long pool.
Las Vegas Casino Implosions : Aladdin, Dunes, Sands, Landmark, Hacienda, Stardust, Boardwalk, Castaways, El Rancho Implosion Videos. While it is always sad to see one of the grand dames of Las Vegas bite the dust, we must remember... without their demise we would not have Bellagio, Mandalay Bay, Venetian, Wynn Las Vegas, Aladdin (again), and a giant parking lot where the Landmark stood.
During its heyday, the Sands was the center of entertainment and cool on the Strip, and hosted many famous entertainers of the day, most notably the Rat Pack. The hotel was established in 1952 by Texan oil tycoon Jake Freedman, who bought up the LaRue Restaurant, which had opened two years earlier.
The opening was widely publicized, and every guest was given a Chamois bag with silver dollars. Crime bosses such as Meyer Lansky and Frank Costello acquired shares in the hotel and attracted Frank Sinatra, who made his performing debut at Sands in October 1953.
Sands Hotel and Casino in 1959. The Sands Hotel and Casino was a historic hotel and casino on the Las Vegas Strip in Nevada, United States, that operated from 1952 to 1996. Designed by the architect Wayne McAllister, with a prominent 56-foot (17 m) high sign, the Sands was the seventh resort to open on the Strip.
Implosion of the Dunes. The Dunes, along with the Sands and the Desert Inn were the three kings of the Las Vegas strip from the 1940s & 50s until they each met their demise in the 1990s. The Dunes was fired upon by the TI adjacent Brittania causing the Dunes to become engulfed in flames and come crashing to the earth.
Pipe Lighters. Both cigar and pipe lighters should be butane. There is no exception to that rule. However, there are differences between the two types of lighters. Cigar lighters, or torch lighters as they’re often called, offer a far more aggressive and hot flame that rises from the top of the lighter.
Summer 93. The pace of twentieth century life isn't your fault. But cigars were invented in a much simpler time and never meant for the baggage compartment of the Concorde, the trunk of a limo, or the bumpy back seat of a taxicab.
Unlike cases, travel humidors are too big for local commuting. The smallest models hold five Churchill-size cigars (one more cigar than the largest standard case), but these are still much too big to fit in a jacket pocket.
Seasoning your humidor. This is a process that allows the cedar in your humidor to absorb moisture so that you may properly store your cigars. When you get a new humidor or utilize one that has not been in use for some time, it is imperative that the humidor is seasoned.
You'll want the case to be lined, so your cigars won't take on a leathery taste, and to prevent the tragedy of a fine cigar's wrapper snagging on rough, less-finished leather. The thickness of the leather is a matter of personal preference. The thicker the leather, the greater the protection.
Today, most smokers do carry their own lighter, but there are many times where you will still be asked to lend a light to someone in need. Of course, lighters are useful for many things, in addition to lighting a cigarette, a pipe or a cigar. One uses them regularly for candles, cooking or even welding.
Generally when you acquire a humidor for the first time the thought is to start off small. Just from experience a 25 count humidor will be of no use after a while. Unless you plan on storing a few cigars at a time you will probably want to start off with a larger 50-100 count humidor. They fill up fast.
An Elie Bleu Medaille humidor. A humidor is any kind of box or room with constant humidity that is used to store cigars, cigarettes, or pipe tobacco. For private use, small wooden boxes holding a few dozen cigars are common, while cigar shops may have walk-in humidors.
Usually placed on the floor as a piece of furniture. Typically holds 1000-5000 cigars. Personal. A small humidor kept in a convenient location in home or office for personal storage, special events, or aesthetics, usually holding 20-75 cigars.
Also, when shopping for a case bring several cigars. (Or use the occasion as an excuse to buy a few.) The first test of any case is how well it fits your cigars. Load the case and see if the you can slip the cigars in and out with reasonable ease. Close the case, to make sure that it is not too short for your cigars.

Basically a beguine is a popular ballroom dance. But, as with other dances, it's roots have a rhythmic foundation. Most know the word, Beguine through Cole Porter's popular big band song, Begin the Beguine. As drummers, we should know how to approach a beguine rhythm in case we're called to play one.
2. music written in the bolero rhythm of the beguine dance. 3. a ballroom dance that originated in the French West Indies; similar to the rumba. Familiarity information: BEGUINE used as a noun is uncommon.
And, I obsess over the beguine rhythm, although I’m not 100% sure what that rhythm actually is. I’ve heard the following variations: Evidently, the rhythm comes from a dance from the Caribbean, emphasizing beats 1, 3 and 4.
Evidently, the rhythm comes from a dance from the Caribbean, emphasizing beats 1, 3 and 4. The in-between stuff seems to vary. I’d appreciate any information on this rhythm, especially the first one. Cole Porter used this rhythm in many of his song as have many composers and arrangers.
Basically a beguine is a popular ballroom dance. But, as with other dances, it's roots have a rhythmic foundation. Most know the word, Beguine through Cole Porter's popular big band song, Begin the Beguine.
I make a reference to the orchestration in “Summer Place” for some strange reason. And, I obsess over the beguine rhythm, although I’m not 100% sure what that rhythm actually is. I’ve heard the following variations: Evidently, the rhythm comes from a dance from the Caribbean, emphasizing beats 1, 3 and 4.
The beguine is a dance, similar to a slow rumba, that was very modestly popular in the 1930s, coming from the islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique, where the Martinique beguine is a slow close dance with a roll of hips.
In these terms, then, the music of “Begin the Beguine” sprang from a Caribbean rhythm and a South Pacific melody. (Note, though: Porter was a notorious kidder and practical joker, and very aware of his popular image. Various other explanations have been offered — by Porter and others — for the song’s origin.
• BEGUINE (noun). The noun BEGUINE has 3 senses: 1. (Roman Catholic Church) a member of a lay sisterhood (one of several founded in the Netherlands in the 12th and 13th centuries); though not taking religious vows the sisters followed an austere life. 2. music written in the bolero rhythm of the beguine dance.

However, if the Y does not provide a separate vowel sound, as when it is coupled with another vowel, it is considered a consonant. In names such as Maloney or Murray, the Y is a consonant, because the vowel sound depends upon the long E in Maloney and the long A in Murray. In general, the Y is a consonant when the syllable already has a vowel.
W is a vowel sometimes, as is Y. There are words in Welsh that use only a W. An example would be the word tow. Without the W the O would not be long. This illust … rates that the W is forming a diphthong, which mirrors the use of the letter U from which it developed. After a vowel, W is considered as a vowel, with an au, oo, or oh sound. Before a vowel it is considered a consonant, with its wh sound.
The sound of the Y is a front glide related to the sound EE (bee) and the sound of the W is a back glide related to the sound OO (boo). A good reason to include Y and W as vowels (vowel letters, actually) is that they pair with other vowel letters to create digraphs which have characteristic sounds. AY, EY, OY, AW, EW, OW.
Strictly speaking, we can never see vowels, so that W sitting there on the page is not a vowel and neither is this A. We can only hear vowels. Vowels are sounds. Loosely speaking, the vowel letters A, E, I, O, and U are often called vowels. Y and W may or may not be included among the vowels, depending on the teaching method. The typical sound we make (in English) when we see the letter W is called either a semi-vowel, a semi-consonant, or a glide.
Answers.  1 However, if the Y does not provide a separate vowel sound, as when it is coupled with another vowel, it is considered a consonant. In names such as Maloney or Murray, the Y is a consonant, because the vowel sound depends upon the long E in Maloney and the long A in Murray.. That s just about the stupidest thing I ve ever heard.
W is a vowel sometimes, as is Y. There are words in Welsh that use  only a W.    An example would be the word tow. Without the W the O would not be  long. This illust…rates that the W is forming a diphthong, which  mirrors the use of the letter U from which it developed.
I've heard this, vowels = A,E,I,O,U and sometimes Y. Generally, if the Y is pronounced like ee, it's considered a vowel but if it's used to start a word like You it's considered a vowel. If it's between consonants or at the end of a word, it's generally a vowel. Otherwise, it's a consonant.
The letter Y is inherently vacillating in its nature and usage, and consequently is sometimes a vowel, sometimes a consonant, depending upon how it is used in the name. When determining if the Y is a vowel or a consonant, the basic rule is this: When the letter serves as a vowel, and in fact sounds like one, it is a vowel.
Also, the Y is considered a consonant when it is used in place of the soft J sound, such as in the name Yolanda or Yoda. In the names Bryan and Wyatt, the Y is a vowel, because it provides the only vowel sound for the first syllable of both names.
Many words have W for a vowel, such as awe, bow, cow, dew, ewe, few gew-gaw, hew, jaw, known, lawn, maw, now, owe, pew, raw, sew, tow, vow, wow and yawn. However, in these cases, the W is only technically a vowel, because it contributes a vowel sound, as would the letter U, from which it originates. Some words, especially Welsh, use the W as the primary vowel, much as Y is used in English. One example is the word cwm (valley).

The three organelles that contain DNA are the nucleus, mitochondria and chloroplasts. Organelles are membrane-bound subunits within a cell -- analogous to organs in the body -- that perform specific functions. The nucleus is the control center of the cell, and houses genetic information.
In addition to the nucleus, eukaryotic cells may contain several other types of organelles, which may include mitochondria, chloroplasts, the endoplasmic reticulum, the Golgi apparatus, and lysosomes. Each of these organelles performs a specific function critical to the cell's survival.
The nucleus is one of the most important organelles in a cell. It is often the largest organelle in animal cells, but this is not always the case. Nuclei contain the genetic material called DNA that is responsible for controlling and directing all cell activities.

The nucleus is the command center of the cell. It houses all genetic information -- inherited from both parents in organisms that reproduce sexually -- in long DNA strands called chromatids. This genetic information is expressed through the production of ribosomes, small organelles that produce specific proteins.

Soldering and brazing involve the same bonding mechanism except that soldering is defined as using filler metals that melt below 450ºC and brazing uses filler metals that melt above this temperature. In both soldering and brazing the bonding mechanism is a reaction between the filler metal and the parent metal or metals. Brazing and
The CuproBraze brazing handbook is a way to share the latest knowledge regarding the CuproBraze process. It deals with technical questions in general. The CuproBraze process is rather young and developments in different areas are still on-going. Therefore, all recommendations in the handbook should be seen as advice,
Step 1, Wear non-flammable clothing, gloves, and safety goggles before you begin the brazing process.Step 2, Clean all dirt, oil, paint, or other residue from the area to be repaired by aluminum brazing. Use a degreasing solvent to get rid of oil and grease. Depending on the size of the repaired area, you may need to sandblast the area or use an emery cloth, grinding wheel, or file.Step 3, Clamp or support the piece to be brazed.

Add flux by dipping the filler rod into the flux when brazing aluminum. If the filler clumps, run the flame of the torch across the brazed area and remelt it and smooth with the rod. If your brazing rod becomes stuck to the repair area, do not pull the rod. This may disrupt your replaced joint or disrupt the repair. Melt the brazing rod with the torch until it releases. If you are repairing a large hole, use backing material or the braze may drip into the hole. Don't skimp when applying the flux.

Silver brazing can employ various heat sources such as torch, flame, acetylene, gas/air, induction, resistance, infrared,oven, and furnace. Silver brazing uses filler metals and alloys such as silver, copper, zinc, cadmium, etc. Flux is necessary for brazing to remove and prevent reformulation of surface oxides on the base metals. Silver brazing produces strong, sealed, leak-proof joints on . Silver brazing uses filler metals in solid form, like rings and wire, slugs, washers, powder, and paste. Proper brazements begin with a good joint design. Silver brazing produces joints that meet specifications that meet mechanical performance, electrical conductivity, pressure tightness, corrosion resistance, and service temperature.
both soldering and brazing. Because of the higher temperatures for brazing, however, interactions are usually greater for brazing than soldering. The interactions are time and temperature dependent. To minimize interactions, the brazing temperature should be as low as possible, and the time period that the materials are held at the brazing temperature should be as short as possible. For more detailed information regarding soldering and brazing in general, see references 8, 9 and 10. Many of the companies who sell brazing materials also have useful information regarding brazing in general.

According to Amazon, the Fire TV is designed to outpace competitors like the Apple TV and Roku in performance: The 0.7-inch-thick box features a 1.7 GHz quad-core CPU, 2 GB of RAM and 8 GB of internal storage, along with a dual-band wireless radio for 1080p streaming over 802.11a/b/g/n Wi-Fi.
But just because Amazon's stick doesn't cost as much as other options, doesn't mean you're not getting the full Fire TV experience. Amazon's streaming devices have access to plenty of services, from Netflix and Hulu Plus to Showtime Anytime and Pandora.
Fire TV Stick [edit]. On November 19, 2014, Amazon released a smaller version of the Fire TV called the Fire TV Stick. It is a HDMI-port plug-in device that replicates much of the functionality of the larger Fire TV. Its hardware is slightly different, it has 1 GB of RAM, 8 GB of storage, weighs 0.9 oz. (25.1g) and the CPU is slower.
There is no automatic service you have to subscribe to in order for the stick to work. If you have Amazon Prime, you have free access to Amazon Instant Video, so the stick will just easily allow you to stream it on your TV (you can get a FREE 30-day trial of Amazon Prime here). YouTube.com is free to stream as is PBS Kids (I think) and probably other channels (that are not that exciting).
We will be purchasing Amazon’s Fire TV Stick even though we have the Roku streaming stick. I don’t exactly know why, but my husband is jacked about it (especially the price). Fire TV Stick connects to your TV’s HDMI port.
The Fire TV Stick connects to your TV’s HDMI port and allows you to stream almost anything, including Netflix, Amazon Instant Video (which is free if you have Amazon Prime), Hulu Plus, YouTube.com, Pandora, PBS Kids and more.
On March 24, 2015, Amazon announced an update to the Fire TV software to provide the following additional features which address some of the concerns raised in early reviews: 1  Expandable USB storage on Amazon Fire TV, the user can connect a USB mass storage device to expand the Fire TV storage.
It supports 1080p streaming and Dolby Digital Plus 7.1 surround sound but is dependent on internet bandwidth of the user. Unveiled on April 2, 2014, the Amazon Fire TV was made available for purchase in the US the same day for US$99 and was launched with a video game called Sev Zero.
Priced at $40 USD, the Fire TV Stick is a bit more expensive than Google's $35 Chromecast, but $10 cheaper than the already-affordable Roku Streaming Stick —like other typical set-top boxes, the standard Fire TV is available for $100.
2. A streaming device (Amazon Fire Stick, Roku, a streaming Blu-ray player, or a gaming device that streams). Here’s the catch though — you won’t be able to watch network TV live. Hulu Plus gives you access to most of their shows within a couple days of the original air date.
