### Test Categories

#### 1. **Concurrent Operations** (6 tests)
Tests extreme concurrent load scenarios:
- ✅ 1000 concurrent writers
- ✅ 1000 concurrent readers
- ✅ Mixed workload (500W + 500R)
- ✅ Hot buffer overflow stress
- ✅ Snapshot under concurrent load
- ✅ RMI rebuild under load

**Key Validations:**
- Hot buffer check works under contention
- Overflow buffer gracefully handles overflows
- No data loss under concurrent writes
- Readers never block writers

#### 2. **Large Dataset** (6 tests)
Tests system behavior with millions of keys:
- ✅ 1 million keys [IGNORED - ~2-5min]
- ✅ 10 million keys [IGNORED - ~20-40min]
- ✅ Large values (1KB) - 100K keys
- ✅ Very large values (10KB) [IGNORED]
- ✅ Sparse key space (1M gaps)
- ✅ Sequential scan (500K keys)

**Key Validations:**
- System scales to millions of keys
- RMI remains accurate at scale
- Snapshot/recovery works with large datasets
- Memory usage stays reasonable

#### 3. **Memory Pressure** (6 tests)
Tests behavior under memory constraints:
- ✅ Buffer overflow recovery
- ✅ Memory-intensive workload (4KB values)
- ✅ Snapshot under memory pressure
- ✅ Concurrent snapshot attempts
- ✅ RMI rebuild memory pressure
- ✅ WAL growth under pressure

**Key Validations:**
- Graceful handling of buffer overflows
- No memory leaks during long operations
- Recovery from memory pressure
- Background merge works under load

#### 4. **Lock Contention** (5 tests)
Tests lock ordering and deadlock prevention:
- ✅ Hot buffer lock contention (100 threads)

- ✅ Reader-writer lock contention (80R + 20W)
- ✅ Snapshot lock contention (10S + 20W)
- ✅ Extreme contention (40R + 30W + 5S + 3RMI)

**Key Validations:**
- Lock order: hot_buffer → overflow_buffer → segments → router
- No deadlocks under any scenario
- Fairness under contention
- All operations complete within timeout

#### 5. **RMI Stress** (4 tests)
Tests RMI accuracy and performance under stress:
- ✅ Skewed distribution (Zipfian 80/20)
- ✅ Frequent rebuilds (20 rebuilds)
- ✅ Continuous updates (10 rounds)
- ✅ Many segments stress (50K random keys)

**Key Validations:**

- Segmentation works correctly

#### 6. **Recovery Stress** (4 tests)
Tests crash recovery and durability:
- ✅ Recovery after write crash
- ✅ Recovery with multiple snapshots

- ✅ WAL replay recovery

**Key Validations:**
- Data durability after crash
- Correct recovery from snapshots
- WAL replay works correctly
- No corruption after rapid restarts

## Running Stress Tests

### Quick Stress Tests (Default, ~5-10 minutes)
Runs all non-ignored tests across all categories:

```bash
cargo test --lib --features learned-index --release test::stress -- --test-threads=4
```

**Or use the automated script:**
```bash
./bench/scripts/run_stress_tests.sh
```

This will:
- Run all 7 test categories
- Report success/failure for each
- Save results to `bench/results/stress_tests/stress_test_<timestamp>.log`
- Provide summary statistics

### Run Specific Category
```bash
# Concurrent operations only
cargo test --lib --features learned-index --release test::stress::concurrent_operations

# Memory pressure only
cargo test --lib --features learned-index --release test::stress::memory_pressure

# Lock contention only
cargo test --lib --features learned-index --release test::stress::lock_contention
```

### Long-Running Tests (1-3 hours)
Tests marked with `#[ignore]` must be run explicitly:

```bash
# 1 million keys test
cargo test --lib --features learned-index --release test_1_million_keys -- --ignored --nocapture

# 10 million keys test (VERY LONG - ~40 min)
cargo test --lib --features learned-index --release test_10_million_keys -- --ignored --nocapture

# 1 hour endurance test
cargo test --lib --features learned-index --release test_sustained_write_load_1hour -- --ignored --nocapture
```

**Or run all long tests:**
```bash
./bench/scripts/run_long_stress_tests.sh
```

This will:
- Run all ignored tests sequentially
- Provide time estimates
- Save results to `bench/results/stress_tests/long_stress_test_<timestamp>.log`

## Implementation Details

### Test Framework Features

1. **Multi-threaded Tokio Runtime**
```rust
#[tokio::test(flavor = "multi_thread", worker_threads = 16)]
async fn test_extreme_load() {
    // Test runs with true parallelism
}
```

2. **Atomic Coordination**
```rust
let success_count = Arc::new(AtomicUsize::new(0));
let running = Arc::new(AtomicBool::new(true));
// Lock-free metrics and coordination
```

3. **Graceful Shutdown**
```rust
running.store(false, Ordering::Relaxed);
for handle in handles {
    handle.await.unwrap();
}
```

4. **Progress Reporting**
```rust
// For long-running tests
println!("Progress: {}/{} ({:.1}%)", 
    current, total, percent);
```

### Key Design Patterns

**Pattern 1: Concurrent Operation Test**
```rust
// Spawn N workers
for worker_id in 0..NUM_WORKERS {
    let handle = tokio::spawn(async move {
        // Perform operations
        // Update metrics atomically
    });
    handles.push(handle);
}

// Wait for completion
for handle in handles {
    handle.await.unwrap();
}

// Validate results
assert!(success_count.load(Ordering::Relaxed) > threshold);
```

**Pattern 2: Endurance Test**
```rust
const DURATION_SECS: u64 = 600; // 10 minutes
let start = Instant::now();

while start.elapsed().as_secs() < DURATION_SECS {
    // Perform operations
    // Report progress periodically
}

// Validate stability over time
```

**Pattern 3: Large Dataset Test**
```rust
#[ignore] // Long-running
async fn test_million_keys() {
    const NUM_KEYS: usize = 1_000_000;
    
    // Insert with progress reporting
    for i in 0..NUM_KEYS {
        if i % 50_000 == 0 {
            println!("Inserted {}/{}", i, NUM_KEYS);
        }
    }
}
```

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions

1. **Run Quick Stress Tests** (5-10 min)
```bash
./bench/scripts/run_stress_tests.sh
```

2. **Review Results**
- Check for any test failures
- Monitor performance metrics
- Identify bottlenecks

3. **Document Results**
- Create `STRESS_TEST_RESULTS.md`
- Include performance metrics
- Note any issues discovered

### Optional Deep Validation

- Validate 10M key scalability

### Tuning (if needed)

6. **Performance Optimization**
Based on stress test results:
- Adjust buffer sizes if frequent overflows
- Tune merge worker intervals if lag observed
