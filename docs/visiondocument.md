# KyroDB — Vision and Architecture

Status: Long-term vision and product strategy. Foundation-first execution.

## The AI Infrastructure Problem We're Solving

AI apps today stitch together PostgreSQL + pgvector, vector DBs, caches, and search engines. This adds 50–100ms latency and heavy ops overhead. Plugins and middleware cannot deliver sub‑10ms hybrid queries.

KyroDB’s mission: an AI‑native database that makes hybrid queries (vector + metadata + time + text) a single, sub‑5ms operation, with a system that learns and optimizes itself.

---

## Strategy Overview

Foundation → AI Value → Intelligence → Scale → Autonomy

- Phase 0: Fix core engine (single‑node durability, RMI correctness, tail latencies)
- Phase 1: Prove AI value (RAG acceleration with hybrid queries)
- Phase 2: AI platform capabilities (experimentation, multi‑modal fusion)
- Phase 3: Intelligent distribution (learned placement/routing)
- Phase 4: Autonomous operation (self‑optimizing, self‑healing)

---

## B2B Use Cases (Practical)

- RAG for support/search: sub‑5ms hybrid retrieval; fewer systems to operate
- Real‑time recommendations: learned access patterns boost CTR and revenue
- Feature stores for inference: zero‑latency lookups; immediate freshness
- Multi‑modal enterprise search: text + vector + filters in one query

Business value: 10x lower latency, 50–80% less infra/ops complexity, measurable revenue lift (CTR/conversion), and lower TCO.

---

## Product Principles

- AI‑native first: vectors, metadata, and fusion are first‑class
- Performance over features: tail latency discipline; zero O(n) paths
- Reliability by design: WAL, snapshots, atomic swaps; defensive testing
- Feature‑gated: benchmarks run at full throttle with no auth/metrics overhead
- Gradual adoption: coexist with OLTP/analytics systems; focused replacement for AI retrieval stacks

---

## Execution Phases (Concise)

- Phase 0: P99 < 1ms lookups, no deadlocks, bounded memory, fast recovery
- Phase 1: P99 < 5ms hybrid RAG on 1M+ docs; streaming ingest with immediate searchability
- Phase 2: Native A/B testing, multi‑modal fusion, model governance
- Phase 3: Learned sharding and routing; cross‑shard RMI
- Phase 4: Autonomous tuning, predictive scaling, self‑healing

Each phase has go/no‑go SLOs and required tests before advancing.

---

## Market Positioning

KyroDB replaces the 3‑DB AI retrieval stack where it matters, and complements existing OLTP/analytics databases elsewhere. We win on latency, simplicity, and autonomous optimization.

Proof points to demonstrate:
- 10x faster hybrid queries vs PostgreSQL+pgvector+Redis
- Zero‑downtime index rebuilds and predictable tails during maintenance
- Lower TCO via unified system and learned placement (Phase 3+)

---

## Adoption & Interop

- Start greenfield AI collections in KyroDB, keep OLTP/warehouse unchanged
- Import via Kafka/Parquet; dual‑write optional
- Stable `/v1` ops API; `/v2` hybrid queries arrive in Phase 1
