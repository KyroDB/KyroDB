## The Problem: AI Apps Have a Latency Tax

AI applications today stitch together **3-5 different systems**:
- PostgreSQL + pgvector (vector search)
- Redis (caching)
- Elasticsearch (keyword search)
- Application logic (query fusion)

**Result**: 50-100ms P99 latency, 3-200ms cold cache spikes, operational complexity.

**Root cause**: General-purpose databases don't understand AI workload patterns:
- **Zipfian access** (80% of queries hit 20% of documents)
- **Predictable patterns** (temporal cycles, semantic clusters, co-access)
- **Hybrid requirements** (vector + metadata + time + text in single query)

**KyroDB's thesis**: A database that **learns your workload** can eliminate the latency tax and ops overhead.

## Our Solution: Three-Layer Learned Architecture

### **Architecture Overview**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Layer 1: LEARNED CACHE                     │
│  Predicts hot documents (Zipfian patterns)  │
│  Hit rate: 70-90% vs 30-40% LRU            │
│  Latency: 3-5ns (pure memory)               │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
           ↓ (cache miss)
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Layer 2: HOT TIER (BTree)                  │
│  Recent writes (last 10K-100K vectors)      │
│  Latency: 20-50ns (fast mutations)          │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
           ↓ (not in hot tier)
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Layer 3: COLD TIER (RMI)                   │
│  Bulk data (millions of vectors)            │
│  Latency: 30ns (learned index prediction)   │
│  Compaction: LSM-style, non-blocking        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### **Why This Architecture Wins**

| Metric | PostgreSQL+pgvector | Pinecone | KyroDB |
|--------|---------------------|----------|---------|
| **P99 lookup (warm)** | 50-100ms | 10-20ms | **<5ms** ✓ |
| **P99 lookup (cold)** | 100-200ms | 50-100ms | **<10ms** ✓ |
| **Cache hit rate** | 30-40% (LRU) | 35-45% | **70-90%** (learned) ✓ |
| **Writes/sec** | 10K | 50K | **50K+** ✓ |
| **Systems to manage** | 3-5 | 1 | **1** ✓ |

**Performance math**:
- Layer 1 (learned cache): 2-3x faster than base RMI
- Layer 2+3 (RMI+BTree): 1.7x faster than BTree
- **Combined**: 3-5x faster than pure BTree, 10x faster than PostgreSQL

## Core Innovation: Self-Optimizing Through Learning

### **What Makes KyroDB Unique**

**1. Learned Cache (Document Level)**
- Predicts which documents will be accessed next
- Learns temporal patterns (9am-5pm peaks)
- Learns semantic clusters (related queries)
- Learns co-access patterns (docs accessed together)
- **Result**: 70-90% cache hit rate vs 30-40% baseline LRU

**2. Learned Index (Storage Level)**
- RMI (Recursive Model Index) predicts data location
- 2 floating-point operations vs 4-5 cache misses (BTree)
- Bounded search guarantees O(log 64) = O(1)
- LSM-style compaction keeps index fresh without blocking

**3. Adaptive Query Routing**
- Learns which tier has your data
- Skips unnecessary lookups
- Optimizes for your specific access patterns

**Contrast with competitors**:
- **Semantic cache (GPTCache, others)**: Query-level caching with 15-30% false positive rate, doesn't solve cold cache
- **Standard vector DBs**: Static LRU cache, no learning, 30-40% hit rate
- **KyroDB**: Document-level learned cache, 70-90% hit rate, zero false positives

Write:  Application → KyroDB (vectors + metadata)
        Application → PostgreSQL (transactions)
        
Read:   RAG queries → KyroDB (<5ms)
